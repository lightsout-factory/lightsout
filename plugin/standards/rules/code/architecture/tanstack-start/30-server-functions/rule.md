### Server Functions

Server functions live in a `serverFns/` folder at feature or app level — the
conventional [domain folder](../../folder-structure/55-ungrouped-domain-utils/rule.md)
for a feature's server calls, this pack's convention rather than TanStack's
requirement. Each server function follows the graduation rule like everything
else: **a file by default, a folder only when it has private companions**.

```
serverFns/
├── countIssuesServerFn.ts        # default: one file, no folder ceremony
└── findIssues/                   # graduated: it has a private companion
    ├── FindIssuesDocument.ts     #   the GraphQL document only it uses
    └── findIssuesServerFn.ts
```

A folder holding one server function and nothing else is ceremony the graduation
rule forbids — the framework mandates nothing about this layout; the trigger
for a folder is the companion file, never the category.
