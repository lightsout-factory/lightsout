## Growing Without New Rules

At every level exactly three kinds of things exist: **modules**, **`common/`**, and **files**. Growth never invents a new kind of place — it is always one of two mechanical moves:

- **Graduate** — a file needs private companions → it becomes a module ([module-file-to-folder](../../architecture-decisions/05-module-file-to-folder/rule.md))
- **Consolidate** — a level holds more than ~20 modules → group related sibling modules under a new parent domain module (recursive: a module within a module)
