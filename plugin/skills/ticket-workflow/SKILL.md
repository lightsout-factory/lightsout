# Ticket workflow

This describes what a ticket looks like — its shape, and what belongs in it.
It does not run the work. The pipeline does that.

A ticket says what is wrong. It does not say how to fix it.

Write down what you saw: the problem, and the facts that show it. Those stay
true for months. A fix you guess at now is usually wrong within a day.

The `brainstorm` and `plan` skills exist so that the user and an
agent work the fix out together, when someone actually picks the ticket up.
Planning is not the ticket's job.

If you have a hunch about the fix, leave it out or write it as an open
question.

**An agent never files a ticket the user has not approved.** Approval means
the user said yes to *this specific ticket*, in the moment — after seeing
what it will say. "We'll do that later", "yes, but later", or any other
deferral is a candidate, not approval: ask "want a ticket for X?" and file
only on yes. A "no" is written down nowhere new — declined means declined.

## One home per fact

Every fact lives in exactly one place, and everything else points at it:

| Fact | Its one home |
|---|---|
| Who the work serves, and why it is worth doing | the ticket's three opening lines |
| The problem, the evidence, the checks | the ticket body |
| Decisions settled before shaping | the ticket's `## Decisions` |
| Decisions made during shaping | each plan's own artifacts, attached |
| Which plans a work order has, its mode, how far each plan's implementation has got, which plans are out of its work, and its request to ship | the work order's record, changed only by `lightsout work-order` and the engine |
| What preparation the ticket still owes | the planning-status label |
| Where implementation stands | the tracker's own workflow status |
| The change itself | the PR diff |

Data flows forward only — ticket → plan files → attachments — never back
into the body. A second copy of any of these drifts, and an agent reading
the drifted copy makes wrong calls: it re-asks settled questions, reads a
check as a scope ruling, or files a ticket for an idea already rejected.

## Template

```markdown
As a/an <role or persona>,
I want <one sentence summary of final deliverable>,
So that <delivered business value>.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Verify that ...
- Verify that ...

## Problem

<what is wrong — observed, not theorised>

## Evidence

<runs, files, numbers>

## Decisions             <- optional

- <an outcome the user explicitly settled>

## Open questions        <- optional

- <a question the shaping has to settle>
```

Those parts are the whole ticket. If an existing ticket carries extra
sections, do not copy them forward — match this template, not its neighbours.

The three opening lines and the checks come first so that a reader knows who
the work serves, what they will get, and how success is judged before reading
a word of the body.

### The three opening lines

Three lines, before the first heading, and nothing else above it:

```markdown
As a/an <role or persona>,
I want <one sentence summary of final deliverable>,
So that <delivered business value>.
```

**`As a/an`** names the role the work serves, never a person — "an LO
Engineer", "a product manager", "a user of the reporting dashboard". Take
whichever article the role reads with. A person's name dates the ticket and
tells a later reader nothing about who is affected.

**`I want`** is one sentence on the finished deliverable, in the same
observable terms the criteria use. It says what will exist, not how it is
built: naming a file or a mechanism here prescribes the fix, which is the one
thing a ticket never does.

**`So that`** is the only place the reason lives. It names who is hurt — an
agent running a plan, a repo adopting lightsout, a plan author, an engineer
on this codebase — and what it costs. On a bug it is one line; the value of
not being broken is obvious. On a feature the reason is genuinely arguable
and this line is the whole case for building the thing — spend the effort
there. If the line would read the same on every ticket, it is telling the
reader nothing; sharpen it.

### Acceptance Criteria

Every line starts **"Verify that"**. Those two words force you to name a check
someone can actually run. If you cannot finish the sentence with something
checkable, you do not yet know what you are asking for.

Write only what someone could check from the outside. Do not name a file, type
or function you expect the fix to create:

- Good — `Verify that no check reads raw carve-out fields.`
  Survives any redesign; you can grep for it.
- Bad — `Verify that FrameworkCarveOut exposes typed dimensions.`
  Assumes the answer. When the design changes, the criterion is wrong rather
  than unmet.

Include the criteria that must *keep* holding, not just the new behaviour. If
a gate stops catching real defects, the work failed even when the reported bug
is gone.

**Criteria are floors, never ceilings.** A criterion records the observed
case, not the boundary of the fix. That a criterion names only one step
means the defect was seen there — it does not decide that the other steps
are out of scope. Silence in a criterion decides nothing; scope narrows
only in `## Decisions`. A check and a decision never share a line.

On a feature, criteria are the closest thing to a spec, with no bug report
holding you to observable behaviour, so a design decision can slip in
wearing a checkbox:

- Good — `Verify that a repo configured for the Pi harness completes a full run.`
- Bad — `Verify that createPiDriver parses agent_end.`
  Names a file and a mechanism nobody has chosen yet.

### Problem

What is wrong, observed rather than theorised. For a feature: what is
absent, or what is worse without it. If you cannot state that, the ticket
is not ready — a feature with no problem behind it is usually a preference
looking for a justification.

Say what is wrong and stop. Why it is worth fixing is already the `So that`
line's job, and repeating it here leaves two copies of the same argument to
drift apart.

### Evidence

Anchor to names that survive edits — symbols, rule ids, config keys, run ids,
file paths. Avoid line numbers: `checkChangedFilesExecuted.ts:110` is stale the
next time anyone touches the file.

Prefer measured numbers over description. "113 summary entries, 0 ending
`.tsx`" beats "the summary seems to be missing some files".

Quote the failing output verbatim rather than paraphrasing it.

On a feature there is no defect to prove. Evidence is what is already true
about the world the feature has to fit into: what a tool it depends on can
and cannot do, what the current code already provides, what you measured,
and what you checked but could not confirm. Same discipline, different
content. If you have nothing, say so in the section rather than dropping
it — "filed from a hunch, no runs behind it" tells the next reader how much
weight to give it.

### Decisions

One line per outcome the user **explicitly settled**, written as the
outcome — "the landing page shows no repository sidebar" — never as the
mechanism it implies.

- **Agents treat these lines as final.** Brainstorm and plan harvest them
  as settled rows and never re-ask them. A settled line re-opens only on a
  contradiction named at a specific `file:line` — or on the human's own latest
  explicit instruction, which outranks every settled line. An agent given one
  follows it, says plainly which settled line it differs from, and records the
  new answer in the plan's own decision records. Nothing goes back into the
  body.
- **Only what the user actually said belongs here.** A hunch, however
  strong, goes to `## Open questions`. This section must never become the
  place a proposed fix hides.
- **Pre-shaping decisions only.** Once a brainstorm or plan runs, new
  decisions land in its files and reach the ticket as attachments. Nothing
  is copied back into the body.
- On a `planning-not-needed` ticket this is the only decision record, and
  that is the point: the ticket with no plan still has a home for what was
  agreed.

### Open questions

A queue, not a record. Shaping drains it:

- Brainstorm and plan take these lines as their agenda.
- **"No" is an answer.** "We will not do X" is recorded as a decision row
  in the plan artifacts like any other. A rejected idea never becomes a
  ticket — and even "yes, but later" is only a candidate: a ticket exists
  only when the user approves that ticket (see above).
- When the ticket goes **Ready to implement**, delete every answered line.
  It is the same edit that puts the attachments on: the answers arrive on
  the ticket in the same action the questions leave it.
- At close the section is empty or gone. A closed ticket that still has
  open questions is the sign a step was skipped.

Leave the section out when you have none. It is the one place a hunch about
the fix is allowed to live, and only in question form. "Should the ceiling
apply per phase?" is a question. "Apply the ceiling per phase" is a
prescription with a question mark bolted on.

## Planning status

Every ticket carries one planning status, which says what preparation it still
owes before anyone builds it. It is a **judgment**, made by whoever writes the
ticket or picks it up, and written down. Never derive it from a proxy — not the
file count, not whether the ticket has open questions, not how long the body is.
A ticket with nothing unsettled can still be forty files that need sequencing
before anyone types, and a twenty-line change can turn on a decision you will
live with for a year.

| Label | Means | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| `planning-needs-brainstorm` | Run the `brainstorm` skill, then decide whether it also needs a plan. **This is the default.** | Notes and settled decisions, and usually a plan after it |
| `planning-needs-plan` | Go straight to the `plan` skill. Set by hand, by a person who wants to plan it themselves. | A plan folder |
| `planning-ready-auto-plan` | Run the `auto-plan` skill. It plans the ticket alone and stops at one proposal. | A plan folder, and a proposal to approve |
| `planning-not-needed` | Build it. The ticket never required brainstorming or planning. | The diff, and nothing else |
| `planning-complete` | Nothing is owed. All required shaping is finished and implementation is waiting. | — |

The five are recorded as a single-valued field on the ticket, and a ticket
carries exactly one of them. Every name carries the `planning-` prefix so it
reads as a classification wherever it appears rather than as an instruction.

**Brainstorm is the default whenever there is design work.** It is where a vague
idea gets shaped, where competing approaches get weighed, and where the thing
turns out to be three tickets instead of one. Reaching for a plan first skips
all of that and plans the wrong thing carefully.

**`planning-needs-plan` is the exception, not a peer.** No workflow writes it:
the `brainstorm` skill decides its own outcome and writes either
`planning-complete` or `planning-ready-auto-plan`. What is left is the hand-set
label a person chooses when they want to plan the ticket themselves,
interactively, rather than hand it to `auto-plan`. It still says a brainstorm
has already settled **this ticket's own** design — usually the brainstorm that
produced the ticket. A brainstorm about a neighbouring ticket does not count,
however much context it shares: the tickets that fall out of one brainstorm are
its by-products, not its subjects, and nobody has yet shaped them.

**`planning-not-needed` is for work with no design left in it.** The change is
local, the diff is describable in a sentence, and being wrong is cheap to undo.
What was agreed with the user lives in `## Decisions`; the criteria stay checks.
Using it is not cutting a corner — but it is a claim, and the claim gets
recorded with the label. It says the ticket **never required** brainstorming or
planning, so it is never written over shaped work: a ticket that ran a
brainstorm is `planning-complete`, whatever that brainstorm produced.

**`planning-ready-auto-plan` is for a ticket whose shape is settled but whose
build is not trivial.** There is design work left, but it is the kind you would
answer with "you decide" — the skill answers it and shows you what it chose. It
owes no evidence the way `planning-needs-plan` does, because it asserts nothing
about a brainstorm having happened; what it asserts is a judgment about how much
of the interview would be delegated, and being wrong costs one veto at the
proposal rather than a wasted plan.

**`planning-complete` is a state a ticket reaches, not one anybody files it
in.** Four of the five name preparation still owed, or preparation explicitly
not owed. `planning-complete` is what the shaping workflows write when they
finish.

A ticket carrying none of the five is **undecided**, which is a legitimate
state. Most of a backlog sits there. Do not force a planning status at filing
time to avoid an empty field — but know the consequence: the queue never selects
an undecided ticket.

### Planning status is not the tracker status

The planning status says what preparation a ticket still owes. The **tracker
status** says where implementation stands. They answer different questions and
neither substitutes for the other.

A ticket whose shaping is finished — the brainstorm ran, the plan is written and
graded — is not waiting on a planning status. It is waiting on someone to build
it, and it belongs in **Ready to implement**. Its label stays as the record of
how it got there; reading it as an instruction to go and brainstorm again is a
misreading, and leaving such a ticket in Backlog hides finished work behind
unstarted work.

A ticket moves through backlog, ready-to-implement, in-progress and done
states, whatever the tracker calls them — the tracker add-on names them.

The queue selects on the **pair** of the two fields, and takes exactly three:

| Planning status | Tracker status | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `planning-ready-auto-plan` | Backlog | The queue plans it, then builds the plan |
| `planning-complete` | Ready to implement | The queue builds the published plan |
| `planning-not-needed` | Ready to implement | The queue builds from the ticket body |

Every other combination is left alone — including a `planning-not-needed` ticket
still sitting in Backlog. The queue neither selects it nor moves it, because
putting a ticket into Ready to implement is the shaping workflow's job.

Move a ticket to **Ready to implement** when its shaping is finished:

| Starting planning status | Becomes | And moves to | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `planning-not-needed` | `planning-not-needed` | Ready to implement | Immediately — there is nothing to shape |
| `planning-needs-brainstorm` | `planning-complete`, or `planning-ready-auto-plan` | Ready to implement, or unchanged | The brainstorm decides its own outcome and writes it. Judged ready to implement, it writes `planning-complete` and moves the ticket to Ready to implement itself; otherwise it writes `planning-ready-auto-plan` and moves nothing, and the plan that follows is what reaches Ready to implement |
| `planning-needs-plan` | `planning-complete` | Ready to implement | The plan is graded and published |
| `planning-ready-auto-plan` | `planning-complete` | Ready to implement | The plan is graded, its proposal approved, and it is published |

"Ready to implement" means exactly what it says: the `implement` skill can be
pointed at it now. For a shaped-and-planned ticket that means the plan is graded
and its durable files have been published to the ticket; for a
`planning-not-needed` one it means the ticket body is enough to build from.

**On a ticket holding several plans, both fields stay ticket-level.** There is
one planning status and one tracker status for the whole ticket, and each plan
that finishes shaping runs the same transition the table above states — so a
ticket whose earlier plan is implemented goes back to Ready to implement when its
next plan is ready to implement. The queue reads only tickets whose tracker status
is one of `queue.eligible-statuses`, and a ticket holding several plans sits In
Progress once its first plan is building. So handing a later plan to the queue's
auto-plan means setting `planning-ready-auto-plan` together with a status that
list holds — Backlog, by default — while a later plan shaped interactively
reaches Ready to implement through the usual transition. Either way, when the
work order's worktree was made by the human's own plan or implement run, the
human removes that tree once its work is committed before handing the ticket to
the queue: the queue builds, ships and removes only trees it owns, and parks a
ticket whose tree another run owns.

### Recording it

The planning status is recorded as the ticket's planning-status field and never
restated in a comment, because a field is current state and a comment is not.

**Whoever picks the ticket up may change it**, by changing the label and
nothing else. The filer knows less about the problem than anyone who reads it
later — that holds for the planning status as much as for the facts. Do not
leave a comment explaining the change: the planning status is current state, and
the same rule applies as to the body. Nobody reading later needs the wrong
version, and the tracker keeps the revision history for anyone who does.

A workflow that finishes a shaping step does not edit the two fields by hand.
It runs one engine command, which writes both together and fails loudly when
either write is refused:

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" ticket-state --ref <ticket> --planning-status <status> --tracker-status <role>
```

`--planning-status` takes one of the five planning-status names above.
`--tracker-status` takes a **role**, not a status name, and takes exactly two:
`ready` or `in-progress`. The repository's own spelling for each lives in
`queue.ready-status` and `queue.in-progress-status`, so a team that calls its
ready state something else configures it once instead of spelling it in every
skill. `--cwd` selects the repository when the command is not run from its root.
A nonzero exit is a stop, never a warning.

There is no `done` role here, and that is deliberate rather than an omission.
Done begins only when a merge is positively confirmed, so the engine writes it
after the merge and nothing writes it by hand — a tracker that says Done must
mean shipped code, not work someone believed had finished.

Setting the *first* planning status on a ticket is still a human act in the
tracker, at filing time or whenever someone picks the ticket up.

**No label owes evidence any more, because the evidence is written at the moment
the brainstorm ends.** The `brainstorm` skill runs `lightsout brainstorm publish
--name <name>`, which attaches both `brainstorm-notes.md` and
`brainstorm-decisions.json` to the ticket under their own names, with a
`brainstorm-attachments.json` integrity marker last. `.lightsout` is gitignored,
so those files exist on exactly one laptop until that command runs — and the
brainstorm runs it itself rather than leaving a human step behind.

That is what makes a shaped ticket readable on a fresh machine, and it is what
`plan verify-facts` fetches back into the plan folder before either planning
skill reads it.

### Do not invent a lighter plan

There is no small-plan format for `planning-not-needed` work. The moment one
exists every ticket gets one, and the ceremony it exists to avoid grows back.

This is not the same as losing what was already decided. A decision settled
with the user before the ticket was filed lives in `## Decisions`, written as
an outcome. That needs no new section and no attachment, which is why it does
not grow into one.

## Branch

`lightsout work-order new` writes the branch once, when the work order is
created, and saves it in that work order's record. Nothing rebuilds it later,
and nothing reads it back out of a folder name. The shape it renders is the
repository's `queue.branch-template` in its `lightsout.config.json` — the
configured template is the format's one home, and this skill points at it rather
than restating a team's spelling.

The branch is the same whichever planning status the ticket carried, and every
plan the work order holds is implemented on that one branch. The **record** is
what links the ticket, the worktree, the commits, the work order's folder and the
PR. It saves the branch and the folder's label as two separate fields, neither
built from the other, so a team whose template carries a prefix gets a branch
such as `feature/lo-140-multi` beside a folder still labelled `lo-140-multi`.
`ship.ticket-pattern` supplies only the tokens a pull request body names.

The engine never renames a branch to agree with a record. A branch may already
be pushed with a pull request pointing at it, so a disagreement is reported for a
human to settle.

## Plan folder

A **work order** is one folder under `.lightsout/work-orders/`, and the record
inside it — `state.json` — is what identifies it. The folder's name is only a
label. `lightsout work-order new` writes that label once, at creation, beside
the branch, and neither is ever written again. There is one writer of a name, so
no two parts of the engine can disagree about what a piece of work is called.

Never rename the folder. Nothing in the engine reads the new name, and a run
records its plan by path — so a folder renamed mid-run leaves `lightsout resume`
pointing at a path that no longer exists. Name the work differently at creation
instead, with `lightsout work-order new --title <words>`.

The work order's folder holds a `plans/` folder, with one subfolder per plan.

### Work orders and plan ids

A plan id is three zero-padded digits, a hyphen and a slug — `001-search-basics`.
The slug is lowercase letters and digits in hyphen-separated words, at most 40
characters. The next number is one above the highest number the ticket has ever
held, counting the plans taken out of its work, so a number is never reused; a
number above 999 is refused. The slug never changes. A plan's display title is a
separate, changeable thing, and `lightsout work-order retitle-plan` is what
changes it.

A plan's **address** is the work order's label, a slash and the plan id —
`lo-140-multi/002-queue-order`. That address is the `--name` value for every
`lightsout plan` subcommand and for `brainstorm publish`, and
`.lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>` is the path `lightsout
implement --plan` takes. The label is the first segment because a branch may
carry a slash, and an address of three segments would parse two ways. The branch
and the worktree are read from the record the first segment names, whichever plan
is being worked.

A plan folder holds that plan's brainstorm, facts, decisions, plan deliverable,
grades and transcripts. The `planName` field of `decisions.json` and
`brainstorm-decisions.json` holds the plan's address.

The record, `state.json`, lives once per machine, in the primary checkout's work
order folder. It is never edited by hand: `lightsout work-order show` prints it,
and every change to it goes through a `lightsout work-order` subcommand or
through the engine.

### Modes

A work order is in one of two modes, and its record saves which.

**Single-plan.** Plan 001 alone supplies the ticket's implementation — that one
plan may still have phases — and the repository's `ship.after-implement` applies
exactly as it always has. A single-plan work order holding no plan 001 is
instead implemented by the queue's build from the ticket body, and ships once
that build passed; work built on it by hand ships through
`lightsout ship --hand-built`. The queue creates the record of a ticket it builds from the
ticket body in single-plan mode, whatever the repository default is.

**Multiple-plan.** Independent brainstorm and plan iterations accumulate on the
ticket's one branch, and the ticket ships only once a ship request is satisfied.

A plan may cover every acceptance criterion of the ticket, a contribution toward
them, or a correction found while an earlier plan was implemented. Its own
acceptance criteria state that iteration's contribution and its checks.

A new record takes its mode from `plan.default-work-order-mode` — the
configuration guide's `### Plan settings` is that key's home — and changing the
key never rewrites a record that already exists.

```sh
lightsout work-order mode --name <work-order> --set single-plan|multiple-plan [--approve]
```

**To multiple-plan** is always allowed. Every plan and all implementation is
kept, and automatic shipping stops: from then on the ticket ships on a ship
request.

**To single-plan** cuts the ticket's scope, so it is deliberate. Run the command
without `--approve` first — it prints the warning and changes nothing — and relay
that warning to the human in full: plan 001 alone decides this ticket's
implementation and shipping, the later plans it names go out of the ticket's work
with their files kept, and what `ship.after-implement` means for this ticket.
Re-run with `--approve` only on the human's explicit yes; a no changes nothing.
The switch is refused once a later plan's implementation has started, partial or
complete, until the human works with the agent to take that implementation off
the branch and the plan is excluded with the removal verified. An agent never
rolls implementation back on its own.

### Starting the work order

Work starts with the work order, and this one command is what names it:

```sh
lightsout work-order new --ticket <ref>
lightsout work-order new --title <words>
```

Exactly one of the two flags is given. `--ticket` reads that ticket's title from
the configured tracker and summarises it into three or four words; `--title`
takes the words you type, exactly as typed. Either way the command writes the
label, the branch and the record together, and prints the label on its last
line. Take that printed label rather than building one.

`--ticket` is refused when no `ticket-tracker` block is configured: there is no
title to read, so name the work with `--title` instead. A label another work
order already carries is refused by name rather than quietly suffixed — a
suffix would be a second author of the name — and so is a second work order for
a ticket one already carries. Both refusals name the work order that exists, and
`--title` is how you name genuinely separate work.

### Adding a plan

```sh
lightsout work-order add-plan --name <work-order> --slug <slug> [--title <title>]
```

It allocates the next id, creates the plan folder empty at progress `planning`,
and prints the plan's address on its last line. The skills take that printed
address rather than building one.

It is refused:

- on a name no record answers to — that is a typo, or work nobody has started;
  `lightsout work-order new` is how work starts;
- in single-plan mode once plan 001 exists — ask the human whether to switch to
  multiple-plan mode before adding one;
- on a work order that has shipped.

In multiple-plan mode, adding a plan withdraws a pending ship request and prints
why a new one is needed. Relay that to the human.

When the work order already has a plan at `planning`, the work continues the
lowest-numbered one — unless the human says this is a separate plan, which is
then added and waits behind the lower one in numeric order.

### Implementation order and exclusions

A plan carries one progress value, and the engine writes each of them:

| Progress | Written when |
|---|---|
| `planning` | `work-order add-plan` created the plan |
| `ready` | `plan publish` succeeded for it — it is ready to implement |
| `implementing` | an implementation run started |
| `implemented` | that run passed |
| `failed` | that run failed or escalated |

A paused run leaves the plan at `implementing`. A plan taken out of the work
order's work records that beside its progress rather than instead of it, so it
keeps the record of how far it got. Every plan is born at `planning`.

Plans implement in numeric order. A lower plan that is neither implemented nor
excluded blocks every later one — whether it is still being planned, is being
implemented, or failed — and the engine refuses the later run in one sentence
naming the blocking plan.

A failed plan is repaired by resuming its run. Replacing or abandoning one is an
exclusion:

```sh
lightsout work-order exclude-plan --name <work-order> --plan <id> --reason <text> [--implementation-removed]
```

An exclusion is final. The plan's files and its history stay where they are, and
a ship request naming that plan is withdrawn. For a plan whose implementation
started, the engine first runs the repository's full gates on a clean checkout of
the work order's branch, and records the exclusion only when they pass. Run this
command only on the human's explicit direction.

An implemented plan is the scope it was implemented against. A change to that
work belongs in a follow-up plan, never in an edit to the implemented one:
`plan publish` refuses an implemented plan whose durable files have changed.

### Ship requests

Only a multiple-plan ticket takes one.

```sh
lightsout work-order request-ship --name <work-order> --plans <id,id,…>
```

`--plans` names the exact set of plans the ticket still includes, as full ids or
bare numbers. A plan left out of the list has to be excluded first. The request
may be filed before implementation has finished.

The ticket ships once every listed plan is implemented and the final checks pass.
Ship reads the listed ids again immediately before the merge.

A request is withdrawn by adding a plan — deleting that plan again does not bring
the request back — by excluding a listed plan, by switching to single-plan mode,
and by `--withdraw`. Retitling a plan leaves it standing.

Until a request is satisfied, the ticket and its branch stay open, and a later
plan that becomes ready to implement is picked up on the same branch. The human
decides the finish line: an agent files a ship request only when the human asks
to ship the ticket.

```sh
lightsout ship --hand-built
```

`--hand-built` authorizes shipping work built by hand. It applies only to a
single-plan work order holding no plan 001 whose build from the ticket body has
not passed. It records who authorized it, by git's `user.name` and `user.email`,
and when, and the authorization stands until the ticket ships.

It is withdrawn by adding plan 001, by a build from the ticket body starting,
and by switching to multiple-plan mode. Ship still runs its gates and checks on
hand-built work. The human decides here too: an agent passes `--hand-built` only
when the human asks to ship, never on its own.

## PR

The PR body is the ticket link, and nothing else — one line: the repository's
`ship.pr-body` template from its `lightsout.config.json`, which is where a
team's tracker conventions live.

The ticket is the source of truth. A summary,
a test plan, or a restated criterion in the body is a second copy of the
ticket, and it drifts the moment the ticket body is edited. A reviewer
needs exactly two things — the ticket and the diff — and the PR already is
the diff.

The PR title is a plain one-line description of the change, like any commit
subject.

## Keeping the body true

The body holds facts, so keep the facts current. When planning turns up a
sharper problem statement, better evidence, or an acceptance criterion that was
wrong, **edit the body to say the new thing**.

Write the new version as plain fact. "The summary holds 113 entries, none
ending `.tsx`" — not "we originally thought X, but it turned out to be Y".
Nobody reading later needs the wrong version, and the tracker keeps the edit
history if anyone does.

Editing is safe here only because the body never held a proposed fix. There is
nothing in it you can be caught out by, so every edit just makes the ticket
more accurate. The same discipline bounds `## Decisions`: edit a line only to
state more precisely what the user settled — never to record a new decision
made during shaping, whose home is the plan artifacts.

**The human's latest explicit direction wins over the body.** A ticket can lag
behind the conversation, and an agent told to build something the body does not
say builds what it was told. Say plainly what differs when that is useful, and
ask whether to update the body — unless the human already authorized that write,
in which case make it. Either way, the answer never holds up planning or
implementation: the update is maintenance, not a prerequisite.

## Closing a ticket

Append one comment, two things, about a line each:

- what shipped
- the PR

Nothing else. Not the criteria and how each was verified — the checks live in
the body, and the PR's gates are the record of their passing. Not the planning
status — the label is the record. Not the story of getting there: what you
tried, what you gave up on, and how the finished work compared to the original
ticket all stay out. If the ticket itself turned out to be wrong, fix the body
— see above.

**There is no leftovers section.** Anything that looks left over is one of
two things. Decided against — then it is a decision, already recorded where
decisions live, and writing it again here resurrects it. Still wanted — then
it deserves its own ticket, which only the user can approve; once that
ticket exists, the tracker's issue links are the record and prose adds nothing.
There is no third category. If a real candidate is on the table at close,
ask the one question — "want a ticket for X, or let it go?" — and write
nothing either way.

If implementation amended a published plan, publish the current version before
closing (see below); do not restate its decision table in the comment. An
implemented plan of a work order is never amended in the first place —
that change belonged in a follow-up plan, per `### Implementation order and
exclusions` above.

## Publishing the plan

The `plan` skill writes `.lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>/` —
either `plan.md`, or `overview.md` with phase files, alongside durable records
such as `decisions.json` and `grade.json`. That is the design record: what was
decided, what was rejected, and why. Publishing works on one plan at a time, and
`<name>` is that plan's address, so the ticket is found by reading the record the
address's first segment names rather than by recognising a slug.

Those files live on one machine. `.lightsout` is gitignored, so the path is not
a link — it resolves for nobody but the author, and not for the author on a
different laptop. Never paste a filesystem path into a ticket and call it a
reference.

A `planning-not-needed` ticket has no plan folder and nothing to attach. That is
expected — its `## Decisions` section is the decision record.

A `planning-needs-brainstorm` ticket the brainstorm judged ready to implement
has no plan folder to publish, but it is not empty-handed: the brainstorm
already published its own two files with `lightsout brainstorm publish`, and
that is the record. What was settled also goes into the ticket's `## Decisions`
before building — the body is where decisions live, never the closing comment.
That ticket becomes `planning-complete`, not `planning-not-needed`: it plainly
did require a brainstorm, and one ran.

**Only the durable set travels when the shaping produced a plan:**

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `plan.md`, or `overview.md` plus every `phase<N>-<slug>.md` | the complete single or phased plan that was built |
| `decisions.json`, when present | every question asked, the option chosen, and why — including which choices were assumptions nobody confirmed |
| `grade.json`, when present | the latest grade and the lenses that produced it |

Publish also writes `plan-attachments.json` last. It is a small transport
integrity marker, not a plan record or run transcript: it names the exact
durable files in that generation and their SHA-256 hashes so a fresh machine
can reject an interrupted or mixed upload before writing anything to disk.

`brainstorm-notes.md` is not in that set. The brainstorm generation owns it and
publishes it, so the two generations never write the same title. A
`planning-ready-auto-plan` ticket publishes the same durable set; when no
brainstorm ran, the `brainstorm-notes.md` its brainstorm generation carries is
the one the `auto-plan` skill wrote for itself from the ticket before planning.

Do not assemble or attach that set by hand. Run `lightsout plan publish --name <name>`
from the machine holding the plan folder. It resolves the complete plan
deliverable plus the durable records that are present and uploads each as a
separate attachment under the file's own name. It refuses when no runnable plan
deliverable exists. A re-publish replaces every same-titled attachment rather
than doubling it, and reports any differently titled durable-looking artifact
left from an earlier publish without deleting it. Those older titles are not
restored unless the new integrity marker names them.

Skip `facts.json` — it predicts which files the work will touch, and once the
PR exists the diff answers that better. Skip `brainstorm-decisions.json`: `plan
draft` merges its rows into the plan, so `plan.md`'s Decision Log already
carries every one of them. The brainstorm generation carries its own list —
`brainstorm-notes.md`, plus `brainstorm-decisions.json` when the brainstorm
settled anything — under its own `brainstorm-attachments.json` marker, so those
rows reach the ticket once as a file and once as the plan's Decision Log, never
twice in the plan's own set.

Skip `dedup.json`, every `*-stream.jsonl` and every `*-rejected-*.txt`. The
streams are the harness event log for each `draft`, `dedup` and `grade` agent —
not brainstorm, which runs no engine command and writes no stream — and they are
roughly 98% of the folder by size. One sampled stream ran 215 lines and 240 KB,
of which 138 lines were token-accounting events. Their conclusions are already in
`grade.json` and `plan.md`; what is unique to them is which files an agent opened
and what it thought, which is a debugging artifact, not something a person
picking up a ticket reads. Keep them on disk — the rejected payloads in
particular are the record of how an agent's report failed its contract — and
attach neither.

Skip `grade-history.jsonl` for the same reason. It is the append-only record of
every grading pass a plan ever had: its last line is the same report the
attached `grade.json` already carries, and the earlier lines are how the plan
got there — which finding kept coming back, and how many re-grades it took. That
is a debugging artifact, not something a person picking up a ticket reads. Keep
it on disk and attach nothing.

### Attachment titles

Every file of a plan's plan generation and of its
brainstorm generation attaches under the plan id, two hyphens and the file's own
name — `002-queue-order--plan.md`. The two markers are the plan id followed by
`--plan-attachments.json` and by `--brainstorm-attachments.json`, and the entries
inside each marker keep the local file names. The work order's own record
attaches as `state.json`.

Publishing one plan never lists, replaces or reports another plan's titles, and
the report of differently titled leftovers covers that plan's own prefix and
nothing else.

`plan publish` publishes the plan's brainstorm generation first whenever the
notes on disk are not the bytes that generation's marker commits, and it moves a
plan at `planning` to `ready`.

### A published record that moved

Every `lightsout work-order` change and every `plan publish` syncs the record to
the ticket when a tracker is configured. With no tracker configured the record is
local only.

When both the local record and the published one have moved, nothing is changed.
The published copy is written beside the record as `state.published.json`, and
one command settles it:

```sh
lightsout work-order sync --name <work-order> --keep local|published
```

Show the human both sides and run it only with the side they choose. A plan whose
published files moved the same way is settled by the same command; when the
published side is kept, the local copy of that plan's folder is moved aside to a
numbered copy rather than deleted.

A publish that fails keeps the local change exactly as it is, and `work-order
sync` retries it.

### Restoring on another machine

Where a ticket carries a `state.json` attachment, the record comes back first —
into the primary checkout — and then each plan that is needed, restored by its
own prefix with every hash verified before anything is written. `implement`
restores the plan it was given, `plan verify-facts` restores that plan's
brainstorm generation, and the queue restores every plan it may build.

Publishing and restoring move planning records only. They never push or fetch
git: implementation commits travel by `git push` and `git fetch` alone.

### Publish when the ticket is ready to implement, not at close

For any shaping that produced a plan, publishing is the mechanical
ready-to-implement step. Run `lightsout plan publish --name <name>` — `<name>`
being the plan's address — when the shaping completes, before moving the ticket
to **Ready to implement**. Waiting until close assumes whoever builds it is
whoever planned it, on the machine that planned it — the assumption this whole
system exists to break.

The transition is three steps, in this order:

1. `lightsout plan publish --name <name>` — the durable files reach the ticket.
2. Drain `## Open questions`: delete every line the shaping answered.
3. `lightsout ticket-state --ref <ticket> --planning-status planning-complete
   --tracker-status ready` — the two fields move together, and only after
   publish succeeded.

The answers — the "no"s included — are in the Decision Log being published, so
the questions leave the body as their answers become durable on the ticket.

`.lightsout` is gitignored. Until these files are published, a plan exists on
exactly one laptop, and any other agent picking up that ticket sees a problem
statement with none of the shaping behind it.

A published plan makes the ticket both **readable** and **runnable** by a fresh
agent. Nothing has to be rebuilt by hand: point the `implement` skill at
`.lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>`, the plan's own folder
path. The engine uses the folder on disk when it exists. When it does not, the
engine reads the ticket reference from the record the address's first segment
names, fetches what that ticket carries and reconstructs the folder before
implementation starts — see
`### Restoring on another machine` above. Run state never travels.

Re-publish before close if implementation amended the plan. Each same-titled
attachment is replaced, so the ticket keeps the current durable record rather
than two competing versions.

Do not paste the plan into the ticket body. An attached file cannot drift.

## Anti-patterns

Each of these has actually happened on this team.

- **Inventing vocabulary.** A one-word section heading nobody had defined
  spread across ~20 tickets, because each agent read it in a neighbouring
  ticket and copied it. Nobody could say what belonged under it. Use plain
  words, and prefer no section to a section you cannot define.
- **Inferred constraints.** Writing "anything that requires reading runner
  config breaks that boundary" as a constraint, when it was a guess rather than
  something observed. A future agent then designs around a limit that was never
  real. State only what you checked.
- **Prescribing the fix.** The consuming agent plans the solution. A ticket that
  names the remedy pre-empts the grill that would have found a better one.
- **Detail written early.** A ticket that will sit for weeks should hold less,
  not more. On the day you file it you know less about the problem than anyone
  who reads it later.
- **Reading a check as a ceiling.** A criterion that named only one step was
  nearly read as a decision to scope the fix to that step. Criteria record the
  observed case; only `## Decisions` narrows scope.
- **Resurrecting a rejection.** An idea the user declined during planning was
  read from `## Open questions` as unfinished work, and a ticket was filed for
  the thing the user had said no to. A "no" is a decision — record it as one
  and delete the question.
- **Filing an unapproved ticket.** An agent read "we'll move this later" as
  a yes and filed the ticket itself, at close, unprompted. The user never
  saw it before it existed and may never have wanted it. Deferral is a
  candidate; only the user's yes to the specific ticket is approval.
