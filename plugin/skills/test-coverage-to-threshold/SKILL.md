name: test-coverage-to-threshold
description: Write tests until the repo’s own coverage check passes, in small batches, each verified before the next. Stop and resume any time. Use when the user asks to raise test coverage, get coverage to the threshold, or make the coverage gate pass. Requires a lightsout.config.json (gates) and a clean git tree.

# lightsout: test-coverage-to-threshold

**This skill is the ignition, not the engine.** Measuring, batching, gates,
retries, set-aside tracking, parking, and resume all live in the engine as
deterministic code. Do not add workflow steps to this file.

## Steps

1. Resolve the plugin root from this loaded skill's absolute path: it is two
   directories above this `SKILL.md`. In Claude Code,
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` may provide the same path; do not assume that
   variable exists in Codex skill shell calls. Use the resolved absolute path
   wherever `<plugin-root>` appears below. Confirm
   `<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs` exists; otherwise stop and tell the user to
   reinstall the plugin.
2. Run it with what the user gave you, nothing more:

   ```sh
   node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" test-coverage-to-threshold
   ```

   Pass through when provided: `--max-batches <n>`, `--allow-dirty` (accept
   uncommitted changes as baseline instead of demanding a clean tree),
   `--cwd <path>`. To resume a parked run:
   `test-coverage-to-threshold --run <id>`.
3. Read the exit code before anything else. `0` finished. `2` stopped with
   work left and can be picked up: the run hit `--max-batches` or a harness
   rate limit, and its last printed line says how to resume — this is not a
   failure, report it as progress. Anything else is a failure.
4. Relay the engine's output verbatim — the per-batch outcomes, the set-aside
   files with their reasons, and the before → after coverage table ARE the
   result. If files were set aside, tell the user each needs a human: they
   likely need source changes before they can be tested. The engine never
   commits — remind the user to review the working-tree diff and commit it.
