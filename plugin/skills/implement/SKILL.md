# lightsout: implement

**This skill is the ignition, not the engine.** It contains no pipeline
logic — no gates, no retries, no state. All of that lives in the engine, where
it is deterministic code. Do not add workflow steps to this file.

## Steps

1. Resolve the plugin root from this loaded skill's absolute path: it is two
   directories above this `SKILL.md`. In Claude Code,
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` may provide the same path; do not assume that
   variable exists in Codex skill shell calls. Use the resolved absolute path
   wherever `<plugin-root>` appears below. Confirm
   `<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs` exists; otherwise stop and tell the user to
   reinstall the plugin or run `pnpm bundle` in the lightsout repo.
2. Run it on the plan path the user provided, **in the background**, so the
   session is free while the run works:

   ```sh
   node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" implement --plan "<plan-path>"
   ```

   Pass through what the user gave you, nothing more:
   - a plan **folder** → hand it straight through as `--plan "<folder>"`; the
     engine branches on what the folder holds (an `overview.md` runs every
     phase in order, otherwise the folder's `plan.md` runs on its own). A plan
     of a work order is handed over by its own folder path — the one ending in
     the plan's id — never by the work order's folder above it
   - a starting phase the user asked for → `--start-phase <n>`
   - a high-level/overview plan for a single-phase run → `--overview "<path>"`
   - an explicit package scope → `--packages a,b`
   - a request to build in the checkout the user is standing in →
     `--no-worktree`; a request to build in an isolated worktree →
     `--worktree`. Neither is the default to add: the engine already
     isolates unless the repository's config says otherwise.
   - `resume` requests → `node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" resume --run <id>`

3. Start a watch on the run, also in the background:

   ```sh
   node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" status --watch
   ```

   With no `--run` it follows the run just started — that run is the one run
   going, and a phased plan's coordinator and its current phase count as one
   run rather than two. It waits for the run to appear, then paints a fresh
   block every two minutes until the run stops, and exits on its own.

   If the command instead names several run ids and asks for `--run <id>`,
   other unrelated runs are going in this repository. Report those ids to the
   user and stop — do not guess which one to follow.

   Now relay it, in a loop, until that watch command has exited:

   1. Read the watch's new output.
   2. Every complete block it has produced since the last read goes into the
      conversation **verbatim** — no commentary, no summary, no reformatting,
      nothing between one block and the next. The engine owns that rendering;
      the skill only carries it.
   3. A read that returns nothing new means the next repaint has not happened
      yet. Say nothing and read again.

   Do not go on to the final report while the watch is still running: the
   engine run has not finished, and there is no report yet.

4. Relay the engine's final report to the user verbatim — it is waiting in the
   backgrounded run from step 2, which has finished by the time the watch
   exited. If the run parked itself (rate-limit pause or escalation), tell the
   user the run id and that `resume` will continue it — the same run id also
   resumes a multi-phase run, picking up at the phase that stopped.

## What the engine does to the ticket

Stated so nobody adds a step for it here — the engine already does it:

- Before the pipeline starts, `lightsout implement` records the ticket's
  planning status and moves the ticket to In Progress. `lightsout
  implement-direct` does the same, resolving the ticket from `--ref` or from
  the branch. The run refuses to start when either write fails, because
  required state must be recorded before source work begins.
- The planning status it records: `planning-complete` and
  `planning-not-needed` are preserved as they stand. Anything else —
  `planning-ready-auto-plan`, either `planning-needs-*` value, no label at all,
  or more than one — is written as `planning-complete`.
- When the plan carries an acceptance-test ledger, the engine writes those
  tests first. Every later change to a test file is reviewed against the plan
  before the gates run, so a test the plan's own changes make stale can be
  corrected, while a named acceptance test cannot be weakened or dropped. The
  run is not done until every named test has executed and passed in the gate
  run. Nothing in this skill triggers that; the plan's own ledger is what turns
  the step on.
- When the plan or phase only renames, it lists its renames in a `## Renames`
  section. Such a phase is built without test writing, without the cleanup pass
  and without the reviewing agent. Instead, before the gates run, the engine
  checks in code that every changed file differs from the phase's starting
  commit only by the declared renames, and refuses the checkpoint otherwise.
  Every gate still runs, coverage included. Nothing in this skill turns this
  on; the plan's own `## Renames` section does.
- When the plan or phase only moves folders and files, its file carries a
  `## Build Mode` section reading `move-folders-and-files`. Such a phase is
  built without test writing, without the cleanup pass and without the
  reviewing agent. Instead, before the gates run, the engine checks in code
  that every removed file was added at its declared destination, that no
  declared move left a file at its old path, and that every changed file
  differs from the phase's starting commit only by the paths the moves change —
  a file that is not text may only move unchanged — and refuses the checkpoint
  otherwise. Every gate still runs, coverage included, though the per-file
  check that each changed file is executed by a test is lifted, since the phase
  writes no tests. Nothing in this skill turns this on; the plan's own
  `## Build Mode` section does.
- Before any source work, the engine resolves the workspace itself: it picks
  the branch, creates the worktree, copies the plan or ticket inputs into it,
  and runs `worktree.setup`. Nothing in this skill creates, chooses or cleans
  up a worktree.
- For a work order's plan, the engine checks that work order's record before
  the run. It refuses an excluded plan, a plan other than 001 of a single-plan
  work order, a plan behind a lower plan that is not implemented, and a plan already
  implemented — one sentence naming the plan in the way and the command that
  resolves it. Relay that sentence verbatim and stop; never work around it. The
  rules behind those refusals are the ticket-workflow skill's
  `### Implementation order and exclusions`.
- The engine records that plan's progress around the run: being implemented when
  it starts, implemented when it passes, failed when it fails or escalates. A
  paused run leaves it being implemented, and `resume` on a failed or paused run
  is the repair path.
- After a passed run, a multiple-plan ticket chains into ship only when this run
  satisfies its ship request; otherwise the engine prints the one sentence saying
  what the ticket is still waiting for. See the ticket-workflow skill's
  `### Ship requests`.
- Nothing in this skill performs those writes. Do not add a step for them.
