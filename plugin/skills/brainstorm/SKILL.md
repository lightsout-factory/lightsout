name: brainstorm
description: Shape a vague idea into a buildable direction through dialogue — checks whether it is one idea or several, offers the competing approaches worth building, with trade-offs and a recommendation, and converges on a design stated in plain words. Use when the user has a rough idea, wants to think through a feature before planning it, or asks to brainstorm. It decides its own outcome — ready to implement, or ready to auto-plan — and always writes the design write-up and the settled decisions, publishing both to the ticket.

# lightsout: brainstorm

**This skill is an interactive conductor, not the engine.** It holds zero
deterministic decisions — no gates, retries, caps, state, or contract parsing.
It runs a few engine subcommands, and only when the idea traces to a ticket:
`brainstorm publish`, `ticket-state`, `work-order new`, `work-order show` and
`work-order add-plan`, plus `work-order mode` once the user has agreed to it. It still
holds no deterministic decision of its own, and it never reads back what it
writes. Triggering is gentle: the
description above is the only trigger — no hook, no forced invocation. Writing
the settled-decisions file below changes nothing about this standing — the skill
never reads the file back; the engine validates it at draft time.

## Question format

**Pick the shape from what the answer is.** Before writing the question,
ask: does answering it mean inventing a name or a short phrase the code or
the user will see — a value, a state, a field, a flag, a message? Two or
more of them: draft the real names as a table under **Options**, one row
each, first column the name, second column a short description of what that
thing is. Exactly one: write the drafted wording out inline, in full, rather
than describing it. Any other question stays prose. The labeled parts below
apply either way — this test only decides whether the names get written down
or talked about, and the 1–3 sentence target counts sentences, not table
rows.

Every question this skill puts to the user uses this labeled four-part
shape, in this order:

**Context:** what the question is about and why it matters, in everyday
words. Write for someone who has not read the plan or the code — never
assume they know the plan's internals. State the problem the question
decides — in everyday words — before naming any options.

**Question:** the question itself, one sentence.

**Vet every option before it is offered.** An option earns its place only if
you would build it and defend it when asked "is this best practice?". Judge it
against how established tools solve the same problem and against this
codebase's own conventions — never against a ticket's wording, or a name or
shape that happens to be in the conversation already. A name, key or value
drafted inside an option passes the same test before it is written down. When
only one option survives, present it alone and ask the user to confirm it;
never add a weaker alternative to fill a slot.

**Options:** the answers to choose between, one per line, each opening with a
bracketed number and its name — `(1) <name>: …` — then what it wins and what it
costs. The number is there so the user can reply with the digit alone; the name
is what makes the list readable to someone who skipped the paragraphs above.
When an option carries risk, say what goes wrong if it fails and what catches
it.

**Recommendation:** the option you recommend, named by its number, and the
one-line why — so a reply of just that number resolves it. The why names the
precedent the option follows when one exists ("ESLint keeps rules apart from the
configs that select them"). A ticket's settled decisions bind the design, but
its wording is never evidence that an option is best.

**Presentation.** Each labeled part is its own short paragraph — bold label,
blank line between parts. No bullet dashes on the labels; the blank lines
are what keep the block readable.

**Extra parts are welcome when needed.** If something the user must know
fits none of the four labels (a safety note, a cost, a deadline effect),
add another bold-labeled paragraph rather than forcing it in or leaving
it out.

**Plain language, always.** No jargon. Never use an internal name — a file,
symbol, subcommand, or engine term — without saying what it means in
everyday words. If the reader would need to open a file to answer, the
question is not ready to ask.

**A label reads like a well-named variable.** Someone who skips straight to
the options knows what each one is from the label alone — nothing borrowed
from the paragraphs above it or from its place in the list. `needs-a-human`
passes; "Not true" and "the third one" do not. When the question is about
which action to take, name each option by what it does ("copy the file each
run", "keep the first copy"). When the question asks you to invent a name,
the drafted name itself is the label. An internal name never appears in a
label, even one explained earlier in the question — the label names what
the option does in everyday words (`checker-per-plan-file`, not
`fourth-lens`).

**Keep each part short.** Aim for 1–3 plain sentences per label. When a
question outgrows that, treat it as a sign it is really two questions —
split it.

**One question at a time is the default here** — brainstorm conversations
are exploratory, not batched.

**Durable question delivery.** A pending decision is the deliverable for that
turn. Put the complete four-part question block in the final response that
waits for the user's answer. Never put the full block in commentary and then
summarize or repeat only its Question in the final response; commentary may
report progress, but must not contain a decision the user needs to answer.

Never put a question to the user through an option-picker tool — the kind that
shows a list of one-line choices to select from. Every question in this phase
is written out in that final response, in the shape above. A picker's labels
cannot carry a Context, an Options list, or a drafted table, so what it saves in
typing it takes out of the user's ability to answer.

## Plugin root

Resolve the plugin root once from this loaded skill's absolute path: it is two
directories above this `SKILL.md`. In Claude Code, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` may
provide the same path; do not assume that variable exists in Codex skill shell
calls. Use the resolved absolute path wherever `<plugin-root>` appears below,
and confirm `<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs` exists before running anything.

## Steps

**1. Understand the idea.** Let the user talk; reflect back what you heard in
plain words. Read the codebase in-context (Read/Grep/Glob) when it answers a
question — never ask what the code can answer.

When the idea traces to a ticket, read the ticket first. Its
`## Decisions` lines are outcomes the user already settled — never re-ask
them, and do not copy them into this skill's exit file: the `plan` skill harvests
the ticket itself, and a copy here would put the same row in the record
twice. Its `## Open questions` are this conversation's agenda. Its
acceptance criteria are floors, never ceilings: a criterion naming one case
does not decide that other cases are out of scope. A "no" the user settles
here is a decision row like any other, and a rejected idea never becomes a
new ticket.

Also read what the ticket already holds:

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" work-order show --name <work-order>
```

It prints the work order's mode and its plans. Where the user's latest explicit
instruction differs from the ticket text or from an earlier plan, follow the
user; say what differs when that is useful, and ask about updating the ticket per
the ticket-workflow skill's `## Keeping the body true` — never hold this
conversation up waiting for that answer.

On a work order that already holds plans, read the earlier plans' records as context
about what was built. They are not this brainstorm's settled rows. A change the
user wants to a plan that is already implemented is work for a new plan, not a
revision of that one.

**2. Scope check.** Judge out loud: is this one buildable idea, one idea too
big for a single pass, or several independent ideas? Several → say so, agree
which one to shape now, and note the rest for later.

On a work order, the same check decides **which of its plans this idea is**.
The default is the lowest-numbered plan still at `planning`, unless the user says
this is a separate plan — the rule the ticket-workflow skill's `### Adding a
plan` states, which also says what adding one refuses. A continued plan that
already holds a brainstorm meets step 7's question about an existing file.

Two cases are asked before anything is added, in the Question format:

- **Single-plan mode with plan 001 already past `planning`:** ask whether to
  switch the work order to multiple-plan mode. A no means this idea is not a plan
  on this work order, and the brainstorm says so rather than adding one anyway.

**3. Approaches.** Present the genuinely different ways to build it that pass
the vetting rule in the Question format — usually two or three; when only one
passes, present it alone and say in one line why the others fell. Give what
each wins, what each costs, and which one you recommend and why. Skip only when the user already arrived with a chosen approach, and
say so in one line.

**4. Converge.** State the design back in plain words — what gets built, what
it touches, what is explicitly out — and iterate until the user confirms it
matches what they meant.

**5. Probe for what is still open.** The session that had the conversation is
the worst judge of whether it covered everything — believing it did is the
exact failure this step exists to catch. So hand the work to a reader who was
not there.

Write the converged design out in full, plus the ticket when there is one, and
spawn a subagent with no memory of this conversation. Its brief: read that
statement and the ticket, read nothing else of the conversation, and answer
with the questions a builder would still have to guess at.

Test each returned question against the escalation bar defined in the
`auto-plan` skill's `## The escalation bar` section, at
`<plugin-root>/skills/auto-plan/SKILL.md`. Read it there — that section is the
one definition of the bar and this skill never restates it. Ask what clears the
bar in the Question format, one at a time, fold each answer into the design,
then probe once more. **At most two rounds**, then stop: a loop with a human in
it spends their attention rather than the machine's.

**6. Judge the outcome.** The skill decides this itself; never ask the user
which exit to take. The brainstorm holds the context needed to judge, so asking
would hand the work back for no gain.

**Ready to implement is only open to two cases:** plan 001 of a single-plan
ticket, and work that traces to no ticket. Every plan of a multiple-plan ticket
ends at **ready to auto-plan**, because a later plan is built from its own plan
deliverable rather than from the ticket body.

Where it is open, **ready to implement** requires **all five** of:

- every file that changes is named, along with what changes in each;
- nothing is left open;
- one package is touched;
- the change adds nothing a user can see — no new command, flag, config key or
  output;
- the test that proves it can be named in one sentence.

Anything else is **ready to auto-plan**. Say which outcome you chose and why, in
one line.

**7. Write, publish, label.** Both outcomes write both files. There is no exit
that writes nothing.

Every plan belongs to a work order, so a work order comes first. Never invent a
folder name and never rename one: `lightsout work-order new` is the one thing
that writes a work order's name, and it writes it once.

**With no work order yet**, create one. Give it the ticket when the idea traces
to one, and the words you would have slugged when it does not:

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" work-order new --ticket <ref>
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" work-order new --title "<a few words>"
```

Take the label it prints on its last line. Behind `--ticket` the engine reads
that ticket's title from the tracker and summarises it itself, so no name is
offered for override; behind `--title` the words are taken exactly as typed, so
offer those words to the user first.

**With a work order**, `<name>` is the plan's address — the continued plan's, or
the one this command prints on its last line:

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" work-order add-plan --name <work-order> --slug <slug> [--title <title>]
```

Take the printed address rather than building one, and relay any notice it prints
about a withdrawn ship request. What that command refuses, and why, is the
ticket-workflow skill's `### Adding a plan`; do not restate those rules here.

Every `.lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>/` path and the
`brainstorm publish --name <name>` command below then resolve unchanged.

Before writing anything, show the settled decisions back to the user as a small
table — question, choice, one-line why, and whether it is an assumption — and
get approval: these rows make the planning skills skip questions, so a row that
overstates the agreement is expensive.

Then write the notes to
`.lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>/brainstorm-notes.md`, plus
`.lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>/brainstorm-decisions.json`
in this exact shape:

```json
{
  "planName": "<name>",
  "decisions": [
    { "source": "Brainstorm", "question": "<q>", "options": "<A / B>",
      "choice": "<chosen>", "rationale": "<one line>", "assumption": false }
  ]
}
```

- `source` is exactly `"Brainstorm"` on every row — the engine rejects the
  file otherwise.
- Every project-wide rule the user stated gets its own row whose `question`
  begins exactly `Global constraint:` — that prefix is what carries it into
  the plan's constraints section.
- A choice the user never explicitly confirmed is written with
  `"assumption": true`.
- One row per decision that establishes or changes a design choice or an
  edge-case handling — not per exchange.

**If either file is already in that plan folder**, a previous brainstorm wrote
it, and what to do splits by case:

The address is not negotiable — `brainstorm publish` reads the ticket reference
off the work order's record, and a folder renamed to dodge an existing file can
never be published. Say what the existing files hold and ask before replacing
them; on a yes, overwrite in place and keep the address. Never rename. When the
work is genuinely separate, it is a separate plan, or a separate work order named
with `work-order new --title <words>`.

**When the idea traces to a ticket**, run these in order. A nonzero exit from
either is a stop: report the exact failure and do not claim the brainstorm
finished.

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" brainstorm publish --name <name>
```

Then, for **ready to implement**:

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" ticket-state --ref <ticket> --planning-status planning-complete --tracker-status ready
```

or, for **ready to auto-plan**:

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/dist/cli.mjs" ticket-state --ref <ticket> --planning-status planning-ready-auto-plan
```

Ready to auto-plan passes no `--tracker-status`: a ticket awaiting a plan is not
ready to implement, and Backlog is already queue-eligible.

**When the idea traces to no ticket**, neither command runs and the files stay
on disk. That is the ordinary case for a brainstorm that runs before its ticket
exists.

**8. Close.** With a ticket:

- **Ready to implement:** name the ticket, say it is now Ready to implement, and
  say the queue's next drain builds it from the ticket body. Print no
  `lightsout implement` command — that command takes `--plan <path>` and the
  engine refuses a folder holding neither `plan.md` nor `overview.md`, which is
  exactly what this outcome writes, so any command printed here could not run.
- **Ready to auto-plan:** print the exact next command —
  ``Next: run the `auto-plan` skill on <ticket>, plan <name>`` — naming the
  plan's address, so the next session plans that plan rather than deriving one —
  and add one line saying that a person who would rather plan it themselves sets
  `planning-needs-plan` by hand instead.

With no ticket, both outcomes point at the folder rather than at a tracker,
because nothing was published. Both lines carry the same second sentence: file
the ticket and run `brainstorm publish`, because until that happens the record
exists on one laptop. The folder keeps the label it was created with — nothing
is renamed when the ticket arrives.

- **Ready to auto-plan:** ``Next: run the `auto-plan` skill with
  .lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>/brainstorm-notes.md``
- **Ready to implement:** name
  `.lightsout/work-orders/<work-order>/plans/<plan-id>/` and say the two files
  plus the converged design are the whole record, so the work can be built
  straight from them. Print no command here either, for the reason above.

## Notes file content

A checklist, not a template this skill enforces:

- the idea in the user's words
- the scope call
- the chosen approach and the rejected alternatives with the one-line why
- the converged design in plain words
- any project-wide constraints the user stated (so the planning skills can carry
  them into their Global Constraints collection)
- the outcome this skill chose — ready to implement, or ready to auto-plan — and
  the one-line why
