# Type & Constant Placement

These placement rules govern **shared** declarations. An exported type or
constant with no second consumer is a file-module wherever its consumers live
— `common/` placement is earned by sharing, never by kind (see the
[shared code placement rule](../../../architecture/folder-structure/05-shared-code-placement/rule.md)).
