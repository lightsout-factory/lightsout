Files stay under ~250 lines (~300 for `.tsx` — JSX and props interfaces earn the slack) — approaching the cap signals a split or graduation. React components and hooks have their own thresholds (see the react patterns doc when it applies).

The cap exempts an index file in any source dialect — `index.tsx` included — because a package's entry is its public API, which cannot take the remedy a size finding asks for.
