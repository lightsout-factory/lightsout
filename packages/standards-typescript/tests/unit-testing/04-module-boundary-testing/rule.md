## Module Boundary Testing

**Default to testing a module's public API** — the files code outside the
module calls, each imported from its own file — and cover internals *through*
it. A boundary test pins
behavior rather than internal decomposition, so a module's internals can be
reorganized without touching a single test, and three code changes inside a
module cost one test update instead of three.

**A direct test on any file is allowed** when the file earns one:

- its cases are combinatorial and driving them all through the boundary is
  impractical
- it states a contract meaningful on its own (a parser, a date formatter — a
  thing callers rely on regardless of which module holds it today)
- coverage a gate demands is genuinely unreachable through any boundary input
  (and first ask whether that unreachable branch is dead code)

A direct test needs no ceremony: it does not require making the file public,
and an existing direct test is not debt to migrate. Write the
boundary test when both would pin the same behavior; write the direct test when
the file deserves one.

**Rules that hold either way:**

- Files with no runtime logic — index files, type-only files, pure
  constants — get no dedicated tests (see the
  files-that-must-not-have-dedicated-tests rule).
- If a branch cannot be reached through any input, boundary or direct, it is
  dead code — flag it for deletion rather than forcing a test onto it.
- A public export whose only consumers are test files may be a deliberate
  promotion whose contract the tests pin; deleting it is a human decision.
