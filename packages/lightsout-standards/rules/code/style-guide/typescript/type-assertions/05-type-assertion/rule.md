summary: "an `as` cast in source code, where narrowing would prove the type instead"

Avoid `as` casts. They tell the compiler to trust you instead of proving the type is correct.

- Prefer type narrowing with `typeof`, `instanceof`, or discriminated unions.
- If an assertion is truly necessary (e.g., a library returns `unknown`), add a brief comment explaining why narrowing is not possible.
- Exception: **test files** may use `as unknown as T` to force invalid input into a defensive branch for coverage (see the unit-testing standards).

✅ GOOD: Narrowing

```typescript
if (typeof value === 'string') {
	return value.toUpperCase();
}
```

❌ BAD: Assertion without justification

```typescript
return (value as string).toUpperCase();
```
