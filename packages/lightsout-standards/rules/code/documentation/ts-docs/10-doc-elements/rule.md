summary: "a tag carrying what its type already says, or a description repeating the code"
checked: false
severity: advisory

## Elements

- **Description**: one or two sentences — what it does and why you'd use it. Focus on *why*; the code shows *what*.
- **`@param`**: name and purpose only — TypeScript owns the type. For object-args functions, `@param` tags document the destructured property names directly. Sentence fragments, lowercase.
- **`@throws`**: only errors intentionally thrown and expected to be caught: `@throws {ConnectionError} When the database is unreachable`.
- **`@returns`**: only when the value has semantics the type doesn't show (a `string` that is a JWT; a `boolean` where `true` means "already existed").
- **`@example`**: for complex APIs or non-obvious usage; minimal and runnable.
- **`@typeParam`**: when a generic's purpose isn't obvious from its name.
- **Interface properties**: a `/** */` comment on a property only when its name and type don't convey the contract (`/** Display name shown in the UI, may differ from username */`). Document an interface at the type level, not on every property.

## Complete Example

```typescript
interface Params<T> {
	fn: () => Promise<T>;
	maxAttempts?: number;
	baseDelay?: number;
}

/**
 * Retries an async operation with exponential backoff.
 *
 * Useful for network requests that may fail transiently.
 *
 * @param fn - async function to retry
 * @param maxAttempts - attempts before giving up
 * @param baseDelay - initial delay in ms, doubles after each failure
 * @throws {RetryExhaustedError} When all retry attempts fail
 */
export const retry = async <T>({ fn, maxAttempts = 3, baseDelay = 1000 }: Params<T>): Promise<T> => {
	// ...
};
```
