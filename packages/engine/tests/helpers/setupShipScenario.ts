 * A real feature branch over a real bare origin, with the gates, the forge and

 *
 * One factory for the whole family because every scenario is the same sequence
 * meeting a different world: what the default branch did, what the gates said,
 * what the forge answered, and what the agent did about it.
 *
 * Git is real throughout — a real worktree, a real bare origin, real merges,
 * real pushes — because integrating the default branch is the whole subject and
 * a stubbed git would prove none of it. What is stubbed is everything that
 * would either leave the machine or take half an hour. The harness is NOT
 * stubbed away: a scripted driver answers the real contract invoker, so what a
 * recovery attempt was handed is read off the invocation it received.
