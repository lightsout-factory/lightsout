/**
 * The `--help` text as `renderUsage()` must produce it, written out by hand.
 *
 * A checked-in copy rather than a call into the renderer: a test that compared
 * the render to itself would prove nothing. This block is the pre-catalog
 * `usage.ts` verbatim, with one deliberate correction — `standards-validate`'s
 * note used to sit at column 68, a leftover of the older `--package` spelling,
 * and the renderer's single alignment rule re-flows it to column 65.
 *
 * A FEATURE adding a command or a flag updates this pin deliberately — updated
 * 2026-08-28 for `lightsout queue` and `lightsout implement-direct`, and
 * again for `queue --file-relay`, for `status --run` / `--watch`, and for
 * `lightsout plan publish` — which also spelled `--name`'s placeholder
 * `<name>`, since `<n>` reads as a number everywhere else in this text. Updated
 * again for `lightsout ticket-state`, again for
 * `lightsout brainstorm publish`, and again for `lightsout self-check` — the
 * engine's own check, which a writing agent runs inside its own spawn. Updated
 * once more for `lightsout plan sync-decisions` — the engine composing a plan's
 * Decision Log from its saved decision records. Updated again for the
 * `--worktree` / `--no-worktree` pair both implement commands now take, and
 * again for `status --planning` — one plan's planning steps in the run block's
 * layout — and again for `status --shipping`, one branch's ship steps in the
 * same layout. Updated 2026-09-11 for `status --queue` — the queue's board and
 * one status block per active ticket — and again for `lightsout plan workspace`
 * and the same pair on every plan subcommand. Updated again for `lightsout
 * ticket` — the eight subcommands that change and show a ticket's record of the
 * plans it holds, and once more when `ticket adopt` was merged into `ticket
 * add-plan --from` and the eight became seven. Updated again for
 * `lightsout report` — where one plan's or one ticket's hours and money went,
 * down to each harness process. Updated once more for `doctor --usage-probe` —
 * the opt-in check that one live harness call still reports its token fields.
 * Updated once more for `status --now` — the run that is going, printed once
 * — and for `status --queue --wait`, which is now what asks the queue form to
 * wait for a queue that has only just been launched. Updated 2026-09-21 when
 * `lightsout ticket` became `lightsout work-order`, its seven subcommands
 * keeping their words: `ticket-state` kept its name, because it is the one
 * command that genuinely writes to Linear or Jira. Updated once more when the
 * `--from` form of `add-plan` was removed, a work order's folder name having
 * become a label rather than an identity, so there is no folder move left to
 * perform. Updated once more for `lightsout work-order new` — the one command
 * that writes a work order's name, reading it from a tracker ticket behind
 * `--ticket` and taking the words as typed behind `--title`. Updated once more
 * when `standards-validate` took `--library` in place of `--pack`, validating a
 * standards library's rules and its pack files; the longer flag moves its note
 * to column 68. Updated once more for `lightsout plan sync-phases` — the engine
 * restating a phased plan's phase table and declarations from its phase files.
