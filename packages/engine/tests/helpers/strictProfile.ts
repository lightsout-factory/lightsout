/**
 * The layout and structure rules the default pack ships `advisory`, promoted
 * to `blocking` — the strict profile lightsout's own repository runs.
 *
 * The consumer repos these helpers build plant layout defects (a second export
 * in a file, a file over its cap) as work the pipeline must do, not advice it
 * may decline. The pack stopped blocking on those by default so a repository
 * adopting lightsout is not stopped on day one by a layout it has not agreed
 * to; a fixture that wants them blocking says so, the way a strict repo does.
