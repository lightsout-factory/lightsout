/**
 * The one resolver every plan subcommand goes through before anything reads the

 * none.
 *
 * The order is a requirement, for the reason `resolveRunWorkspace` gives: the
 * flags are read first, isolation is decided from the flags and then
 * `plan.worktree`, and nothing touches git at all when isolation is off. The
 * tree is `resolveWorktreePath`'s, so planning, the queue and `implement` agree
 * on where a branch's tree sits.
 *
 * The branch is whatever the plan's work order record stores, never the plan's
 * own address and never its first segment, so every plan of one work order
 * plans in the one tree on the one branch even when a prefixed template made
 * the two different strings. A `--name` no work order claims is refused rather
 * than planned on a branch nothing authored. For an address the work order's
 * branch is settled first — a branch only the remote holds supplies the start
 * point, and a branch behind or diverged from the pushed one is refused —
 * because a later plan must be researched against the implementation the branch
 * already carries.
 *
 * A session already standing in that tree is answered as it stands, whatever
 * its record says: it adopts nothing, having moved nowhere, which is what keeps
 * every tree cut before ownership was recorded working. From anywhere else, the
 * record decides.
 *
 * It never falls back to the launching checkout, never exits and never writes to
 * the console — the command owns the exit code and the printing.
