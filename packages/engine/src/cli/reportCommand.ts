 * is folded from those marks when they are read. The name may address one plan,
 * or a work order holding several plans.
 *
 * `--json` prints the same totalled tree as data and no table, so a later chart
 * reads the one calculation this table reads rather than a second one of its
 * own. The payload carries the tree rather than any pre-formatted string, which
 * is the whole point of the flag.
 *

 * report and loses only the estimated-cost column, because a report is never
 * withheld for want of a price list.
