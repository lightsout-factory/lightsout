 * Jira stores "A blocks B" once, as a link between the two; from B's side it is
 * the inward end, so the blockers of an issue are the `inwardIssue` of its links
 * whose inward description is 'is blocked by' — the default wording of Jira's
 * own 'Blocks' link type, which a site is free to rename.
 *
 * A blocker whose status category cannot be read is kept rather than dropped:
 * waiting one extra run is recoverable, shipping a dependent ahead of its
 * blocker is not.
