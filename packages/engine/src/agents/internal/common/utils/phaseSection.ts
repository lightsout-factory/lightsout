### Writing against the declaration

- The declared \`creates\`, \`exports\` and \`scripts\` are a **floor, not a ceiling**. Your file MUST create every declared path, export every declared name and add every declared script — and is free to create whatever else the phase needs. The declaration lists only what crosses a phase boundary, so an internal file no other phase touches is never in it.
- The declared \`createdCount\` and \`touchedCount\` are the overview agent's **estimate** and are not a target. Write what the work requires; the engine stamps the real counts into the overview afterwards. The only hard limits are the created-file ceiling, the touched-file ceiling of ${touchedFileCeiling} source files (which no \`## File Budget\` raises, and which a rename-only phase is exempt from), and this phase's own \`## File Budget\`.
- \`## What Next Plan Expects\` states this phase's own declared \`creates\`, \`exports\` and \`scripts\`, each in a backticked span, and nothing else. Write \`None.\` when every bullet of your declaration is \`none\`, and \`None — final phase.\` when your row is the last in the overview's \`## Phases\` table.
- \`## Prerequisites\` states the previous phase's declared \`creates\`, \`exports\` and \`scripts\`, each in a backticked span. Phase 1 states the pre-feature codebase state instead.
- \`## File Budget\` is written when the declaration carries a \`fileBudget\`, repeating that integer. If your phase's real work needs a HIGHER budget than the declaration states, write **the number you need** — never the declared one — and omit the section entirely if you need none. The mismatch is reported and resolved against the overview later; understating your budget to avoid a finding is the one thing that would actually break the run.
