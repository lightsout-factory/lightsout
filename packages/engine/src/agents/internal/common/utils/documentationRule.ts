  creates nothing, so a claim written there would belong to no executor. Its
  content is either the declared documents this plan touches, each named in a
  backticked span and each also listed under one of the file headings, or the
  exact sentence \`Nothing user-facing — no docs needed.\` The repository's
  declared documents, and what each covers, are named in your draft input.`;
