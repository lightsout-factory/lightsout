It composes every engine-owned section — the \`## Decision Log\` and the \`## Global Constraints\` from the same decision records you were handed, and the pairing of each \`## Phases\` row with its declaration heading on an overview — in every plan file of this plan. Those sections are not yours to write, and composing them first is what keeps the lint below from reporting them against you. Then run:

`;

	return `## Self-lint

After writing the plan file(s) and before reporting, run:

${sync}\`${lintCommand}\`

It prints structural findings and exits 1 while any remain, 0 when clean. Fix each finding in the plan file(s) and re-run until it exits 0. If a re-run reports the identical findings twice, stop and report anyway. If the command itself cannot be executed (denied tool, sandbox), skip it — the checklist self-review still applies and the engine re-lints your output either way.`;
