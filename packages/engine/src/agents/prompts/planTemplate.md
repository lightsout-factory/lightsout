# Plan Template

Templates for plans consumed by `lightsout implement` and graded by the
deterministic structural lint (`plan grade`, structure) and the gap-check agent
(`plan grade`, decisions). Three variants: **Single Plan** (standalone feature),
**Overview Plan** (multi-phase context), and **Phase Plan** (one implementation
scope under an overview).

## Rules (all variants)

These mirror the structural-lint and gap-check rubrics — a plan violating them
will not reach A:

- **No placeholders.** No `???`, `TBD`, `TODO`, or unresolved `{tokens}`. Every
  open question must be resolved before the plan is written.
- **Every referenced path verified.** Files listed under Files to Modify and
  Patterns to Mirror must exist on disk at write time. Files to Create must not.
- **Backticks around a path assert it exists.** Every backticked span that
  names a file — anywhere in the plan, not only under the file headings — is
  checked against the working tree and blocks if it is not there. A path
  written to illustrate a shape rather than to name a real file goes in plain
  prose, without backticks. Search patterns are exempt: a span holding `*` is
  read as a glob, never as a claim.
- **Earlier-phase files have their own heading.** In a phased plan, a file an
  EARLIER PHASE creates is changed under `## Files to Modify from Earlier
  Phases` — never `## Files to Modify` (whose paths exist on disk today) and
  never `## Files to Create` (whose paths no phase has claimed). A file an
  earlier phase's folder move carried is named the same way, by its new path
  under `## Files to Modify from Earlier Phases`. Deletes and
  moves have their own headings too; every path under all five is checked and
  counted.
- **Hand-offs chain by name.** Each phase's `## What Next Plan Expects` and the
  next phase's `## Prerequisites` must name the same files and exports, in
  backticked spans — a file path or a bare symbol name. A name one phase hands
  forward and the next never claims is a structural defect.
- **Signatures, not vibes.** Services and modules define their methods and
  signatures — never "create a service for X" without saying what it exposes.
- **Explicit dependency graph.** Module definitions include imports/exports;
  cross-module wiring is stated (exports match imports).
- **Real script names.** Verification commands reference scripts that exist in
  the target `package.json` (or the configured `scripts` overrides).
- **Within the created-file ceiling.** Each plan (or each phase) CREATES at most
  {{createdFileCeiling}} source files. This is a hard ceiling: a phase over it is split, and no
  declaration raises it. A created file has to be specified — its signatures, its
  exports, its behaviour written out — which is what makes creating that many of
  them a full phase.
- **Touched files counted and declared.** Each plan (or each phase) also states
  how many source files it touches in total (created, modified, modified from an
  earlier phase, deleted, and both sides of every move). A folder move counts
  every file it carries, on both sides. Above {{fileLimit}} the plan is
  still legal, but it must carry a `## File Budget` covering its real count,
  because {{fileLimit}} is where the implementing agent stops. A plan or phase that
  touches more than {{touchedFileCeiling}} source files is refused and must be split:
  neither the config nor a `## File Budget` raises that ceiling. There are two
  exemptions. One is a rename-only plan or phase — its `## Renames` section, plus the
  `**Renames only:** yes` bullet on the overview. The other is a
  move-folders-and-files plan or phase — its `## Build Mode` section reading
  `move-folders-and-files`, plus the `**Moves folders and files only:** yes`
  bullet on the overview. A phase that creates three files
  and renames an import across two hundred is legitimate work only as a rename-only
  phase, with the rename gathered into a phase of its own; a phase that authors
  that many from scratch is not. Likewise, a phase that relocates a folder of
  three hundred files is legitimate work only as a move-folders-and-files phase,
  with the move gathered into a phase of its own.
- **What counts as a source file.** Every path the plan names except test files,
  `index` barrels, and `.d.ts` declaration files. A hand-authored type-only
  module — a `.ts` file exporting one interface — DOES count: it still has to be
  specified and written.
- **Prior art recorded.** Every newly-created exported symbol is justified in a
  `## Prior Art` section: the searches run against existing exports that prove it
  is new, or the existing symbol it mirrors/extends.
- **Global constraints have a home.** Every variant carries a
  `## Global Constraints` section for session-stated project-wide constraints;
  `None` is valid content. Phases inherit the overview's — a phase may write
  "See overview."
- **Rename-only phases.** A plan or phase whose whole work is renaming symbols
  or paths may be declared rename-only with a `## Renames` section, one `-`
  bullet per rename naming the old and the new text, each in backticks. Gather
  renames into their own phase where you can, covering every file the rename
  spans. A rename-only file creates nothing, and it is built without test
  writing: the engine checks in code that every changed file differs from the
  phase's start only by the declared renames. Each rename is a literal,
  case-sensitive substitution of every occurrence, applied in the order listed,
  to file paths and file contents alike — and no rename's new text may contain
  any rename's old text, own or another's.
- **Move-folders-and-files phases.** A plan or phase whose whole work is moving
  folders and files may be declared move-folders-and-files with a `## Build Mode`
  section whose body is the single line `move-folders-and-files`. Its
  `## Files to Move` headings name file moves and folder moves: a folder move
  names two folders, each ending in `/`, never one file and one folder. It lists
  nothing under Files to Create, Files to Modify or Files to Delete, carries no
  `## Renames`, and states no Acceptance Tests rows. It needs no `## File Budget`
  and is exempt from the touched-file ceiling. A move and feature work are two
  phases. A destination folder must not already exist, and the moves in one
  phase must not overlap, chain or swap. It is built without test writing,
  without the reviewing agent and without refactor: the engine instead checks in
  code that every removed file pairs with an added file at its declared
  destination, that no declared move left a file at its old path, and that every
  changed file differs from the phase's start only in the paths that point at
  moved files, every other character staying as it was. A file that is not text,
  such as a binary, may only move unchanged.

## Single Plan

```markdown
# <Feature Name>

## Context

<1–2 paragraphs: what this feature does, why it is needed, and the relevant
current state of the codebase.>

## Decision Log

Composed by the engine with `lightsout plan sync-decisions` from this plan's
saved decision records. Write neither this heading's content nor a row: the
engine puts the section in place, and anything written here is replaced.

## Global Constraints

Project-wide constraints the user stated for this work — rules every part of
the implementation must respect. Write `None` when none were stated.

- <constraint, or "None">

## Prerequisites

- <required state before implementation begins, or "None">

## Affected Packages

- `<packagesDir>/<name>` — <why this package is touched>

<!-- Single-package repos: state "Single-package repository." packagesDir is the
repo's package directory convention (default `packages`). -->

## Files to Create

### `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/path/to/file.ts`

<Purpose. Key contents: exported functions/classes with full signatures,
methods, imports it needs, what it exports. Enough detail that a fresh-context
agent writes the right code without guessing.>

## Files to Modify

### `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/path/to/existing.ts`

<What changes and where: which function/section, what is added/removed/changed,
and how it integrates with the created files.>

## Files to Modify from Earlier Phases

<Optional — omit the heading entirely when this plan has no such work. Every
path here must be one an EARLIER PHASE creates, and must not exist on disk yet;
a file that is already there belongs under Files to Modify.>

### `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/path/to/from-phase-one.ts`

<Which phase creates it, and what changes here.>

## Files to Delete

<Optional — omit the heading entirely when this plan deletes nothing.>

### `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/path/to/going.ts`

<Why it goes, and what takes over its callers.>

## Files to Move

<Optional — omit the heading entirely when this plan moves nothing. Each
subheading names two files or two folders in backticks, old then new, a folder
written with a trailing `/`.>

### `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/old/path.ts` → `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/new/path.ts`

<What moves and why.>

### `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/old/folder/` → `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/new/folder/`

<What moves and why.>

## File Budget

<Optional — omit this section unless the plan touches more than {{fileLimit}}
source files. A single integer on its own line: the total source files this plan
touches. It must cover the real count, and it does NOT raise the created-file
ceiling, which is fixed at {{createdFileCeiling}}.>
<Nor does it raise the touched-file ceiling, which is fixed at
{{touchedFileCeiling}} for every plan that is neither rename-only nor
move-folders-and-files.>

## Renames

<Optional — omit the heading entirely unless this plan is rename-only. One
bullet per rename, the old text then the new, each in backticks, in the order
they are applied. A rename-only plan lists nothing under Files to Create.>

- `<oldName>` → `<newName>`

## Build Mode

<Optional — omit the heading entirely unless this plan is
move-folders-and-files. Its body is the one line below. A plan carrying it
carries no `## Renames`.>

move-folders-and-files

## Patterns to Mirror

- `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/path/to/analogous.ts` — <what to take from it:
  structure, naming, error handling, etc.>

## Prior Art

One line per newly-created exported symbol, recording the dedup search that
justifies its newness:

- `<symbol>` — searched <terms>, found none (new)
- `<symbol>` — mirrors `<existing export>` (extends, does not duplicate)

## Scope Boundaries

**Do:**
- <in-scope item>

**Do NOT:**
- <explicitly out-of-scope item — adjacent work the agent might be tempted to do>

## Verification

- `<resolved check command>` — types clean
- `<resolved test-unit command>` — tests pass

## What Next Plan Expects

<For a standalone plan: "None — standalone plan." Otherwise: the exact state a
follow-up plan can rely on — files that exist, exports available, behavior
guaranteed.>
```

## Overview Plan

The overview carries context shared by all phases. It is **not implemented
directly** — it is passed alongside each phase to `lightsout implement` and to
`plan grade` as context.

```markdown
# <Feature Name> — Overview

## Context

<What this feature does, why, and the relevant current state.>

## Decision Log

Composed by the engine with `lightsout plan sync-decisions` from this plan's
saved decision records. Write neither this heading's content nor a row: the
engine puts the section in place, and anything written here is replaced. The
overview holds the plan's complete history; each phase file points at it.

## Global Constraints

Project-wide constraints the user stated for this work — rules every part of
the implementation must respect. Write `None` when none were stated.

- <constraint, or "None">

## Architecture

<How the pieces fit together across phases: data flow, module boundaries,
shared types. A diagram or short prose map.>

## Affected Packages

- `<packagesDir>/<name>` — <role in this feature>

## Phases

Creates and Touches are integer counts of source files — the same set the
created-file ceiling and the touched-file budget are measured on (test files,
`index` barrels and `.d.ts` declarations excluded; a hand-authored type-only
module counts). Each must equal the count the phase file itself lists.

| # | File | Scope | Creates | Touches |
|---|------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `phase1-<slug>.md` | <one-line scope> | <n> | <n> |
| 2 | `phase2-<slug>.md` | <one-line scope> | <n> | <n> |

## Phase Declarations

One block per phase, listing ONLY what crosses a phase boundary: the files a
later phase builds against, the exported names later phases import, and the
package scripts this phase adds. The phase file already holds its complete file
list — repeating it here creates two lists that drift the moment either is
edited. Write `none` for a bullet with nothing to declare.

### Phase 1 — `phase1-<slug>.md`

- **Creates:** `<packagesDir>/<name>/src/path/to/file.ts`
- **Exports:** `<symbol>`
- **Scripts:** none

### Phase 2 — `phase2-<slug>.md`

- **Creates:** none
- **Exports:** none
- **Scripts:** none
- **File budget:** <n>
- **Renames only:** yes

<!-- **File budget:** is optional: include it only when that phase file carries a
`## File Budget`, and repeat the same integer. It must cover that phase's Touches
count, and it never raises the created-file ceiling, which is fixed at
{{createdFileCeiling}}. It never raises the touched-file ceiling of
{{touchedFileCeiling}} either; only a phase declared `**Renames only:** yes` or
`**Moves folders and files only:** yes` is exempt from that one. **Renames only:**
is optional too: write it, reading `yes`, only for a phase whose file carries a
`## Renames` section. **Moves folders and files only:** is optional as well:
write it, reading `yes`, only for a phase whose file carries a `## Build Mode`
section reading `move-folders-and-files`, never beside **Renames only:** in one
block, and with no **File budget:**. Such a phase's **Creates:** may name the
destination folder exactly as its `## Files to Move` heading writes it, rather
than every file the folder carries. -->

## Cross-Phase Dependencies

- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1's <export/file/behavior>.
```

---

## Phase Plan

Identical to the Single Plan with these adjustments:

- Title: `# <Feature Name> — Phase <N>: <Phase Name>`
- **Prerequisites** states the prior phase's end state: "Phase <N-1> complete:
  <files/exports that now exist>." Phase 1 states the pre-feature codebase state.
- **Decision Log** is composed by the engine with
  `lightsout plan sync-decisions`, exactly as in the Single Plan: write neither
  the heading's content nor a row. A phase file's section points at the
  overview's complete history rather than repeating it.
- **Global Constraints** is required in every phase; when the overview's section
  covers it, the content may be "See overview." Phase-specific constraints are
  added as their own bullets.
- **Prior Art** is still mandatory — one line per newly-created exported symbol.
- **Files to Modify from Earlier Phases** is where a file an earlier phase
  creates is changed — never Files to Modify (whose paths must exist on disk
  today) and never Files to Create (whose paths no phase has claimed yet).
- **Files to Delete**, **Files to Move** and **File Budget** carry the same
  meaning as in the Single Plan, per phase.
- **What Next Plan Expects** is mandatory and chains: it must list exactly what
  the next phase's Prerequisites will claim. The final phase states "None —
  final phase."
