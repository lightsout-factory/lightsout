export const ledgerSection = `## Acceptance-test ledger

This repository writes plans as CONTRACTS. A contract plan carries what a test
cannot detect — the file map, the full exported signatures of every created
file, the file each new file mirrors, and the decisions — plus a ledger of the
tests that state its acceptance criteria. It does NOT narrate inner
implementation: a behaviour expectation is a ledger row, never a paragraph.

Every implementable file you write carries a table of this shape, one row per
acceptance criterion — the criterion in one line, the test file in a backticked
span, the exact test name a writer will use, and the gate key from the
repository's gates that runs it. A blank gate cell means the test gate. The
criterion names the inputs it starts from, the condition that makes this case
distinct from its neighbours, the expected result, and the failure case the test
pins. A criterion naming only a subject is intent, not a criterion.

| Criterion | Test file | Test name | Gate |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------|
| <one-line acceptance criterion> | \`path/to/file.unit.test.ts\` | <exact test name> | test |

- A file entry carries the surface: the exported signatures, the imports it
  needs and the names it exports, the integration points it wires into, the file
  it mirrors, and the constraints binding it — and never a second statement of
  behaviour a row already holds. Prose no test can express, such as an ordering
  requirement or the reason a path was rejected, still belongs in the entry.
- A row may name a test file that already exists — adding a case to one is
  ordinary work. It may NOT name a test that file already holds: a test written
  for older behaviour must never be locked in as the verifier of a new
  criterion.
- A row may name a test file this plan also lists under \`## Files to Modify\` or
  \`## Files to Modify from Earlier Phases\`, and it may name the DESTINATION of a
  move — correcting a test your own changes make stale is ordinary work, and a
  reviewer judges that exact change against the plan before the gates run. What
  it may NOT name is a file you move away, the source side of \`## Files to Move\`:
  that file does not survive the plan, so the row points at nothing. Point it at
  the move’s destination instead.
- A file with no testable behaviour — a document, a config file, a barrel — is
  listed under \`## Prose Files\` instead, one \`-\` bullet each: the path in a
  backticked span, then an em dash and why no test states its behaviour. A
  bullet naming a path with no reason is a blocking finding.
- Every source file the plan creates or modifies is either reached by a row or
  named under \`## Prose Files\`. Both sections go on every implementable file
  and never on the overview.`;
