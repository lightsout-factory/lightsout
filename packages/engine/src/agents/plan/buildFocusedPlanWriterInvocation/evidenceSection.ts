The engine read the files this assignment touches and collected the evidence
below from them, once for the whole draft. It stands in place of your re-reading
them: start here rather than opening a file this section already covers.

You still have file tools, and this is not the limit of what you may look at.
Open anything the evidence does not answer. Where what you find and what your
inputs state cannot be reconciled, report the discrepancy and stop the draft —
never resolve it with a guess.
