// arrangement can hurry: a real wait reports unfinished only at its half-hour
// ceiling, and no stubbed forge brings that ceiling closer. Everything else
// here stays real — a real worktree, a real push, a fake `gh` on PATH — so what
// these tests pin is what the sequence does with a wait that ran out, not how
// the waiting itself works, which the wait's own tests cover.
