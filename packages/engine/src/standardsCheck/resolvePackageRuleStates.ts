 * Two protections live here because this is the first moment the valid rule ids
 * exist at all. Two packs claiming one id would make config overrides and
 * site keys ambiguous, and a config key naming no loaded rule is a typo that
 * would otherwise disable a policy its author believes is live — the same
 * refusal the closed rule enum used to give while parsing the config file.
 *
 * @throws {Error} When two packs claim one rule id, or a config entry names no loaded rule.
