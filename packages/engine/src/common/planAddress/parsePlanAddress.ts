 * rather than splitting a name of its own.
 *
 * Undefined is not a failure on its own: a work order's name is a valid answer
 * wherever a whole ticket is meant, and each caller decides. A first segment that is empty, `.` or `..` is refused
 * because it would resolve outside the plans directory.
