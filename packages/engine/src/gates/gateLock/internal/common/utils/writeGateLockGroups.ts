 * Persist the gate process groups executing right now into the reservation.
 *
 * The group list is the one part of the document that moves while the machine
 * is held — there is no heartbeat and no timer — so this runs only when the set
 * changes. `startedAt` is never rewritten: it is what lets a waiter report the
 * reservation's age.
 *
 * Only our own document is rewritten, following the same rule as
 * `releaseGateLock`. A write that fails is swallowed rather than raised: a
 * reservation that is held must not be dropped over a transient write.
 *
 * The read-then-write is not atomic and does not need to be. Reclaiming
 * requires the holder's pid to be dead, and a process whose pid is dead is
 * running no group write, so the window in which a reclaimer could unlink
 * between our read and our write cannot open. Written down so nobody reaches
 * for file locking to close a gap that is not there.
