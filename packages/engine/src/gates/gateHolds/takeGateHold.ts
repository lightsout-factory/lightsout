 *
 * Exactly two situations take no hold: a repository with no `ticket-tracker`
 * block, and a run with no ticket reference. There is no label to write and no
 * refusal site that could read one. Every other tracker failure — a missing
 * credential above all — still records the hold unconfirmed, because letting a
 * fully configured repository time out and record nothing is the silent
 * pass-through this hold exists to stop.
