/**
 * The release rule lives here and nowhere else. A hold whose label write was
 * confirmed clears when the ticket comes back and its labels no longer carry the
 * blocked label — nothing else counts as release. A tracker read that failed
 * keeps every hold, because reading a failure as release would drop every hold
 * on the machine during an outage; and a ticket the tracker does not return is
 * unknown rather than released, because a hold nobody can look up is one a
 * human still has to settle.
 *
 * A hold whose label write never succeeded has that write re-attempted here and
 * keeps blocking either way, with the failure reported every time until it
 * lands.
 *
 * Only the holds it changes are written back, so a worker recording a hold for
 * another ticket in the same moment is untouched. The empty short circuit means
 * a repository that has never timed out makes no tracker call here at all.
 *
 * It reads and writes the tracker, so it is never called while a gate
 * reservation is held.
