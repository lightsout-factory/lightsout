/**
 * Assemble the argv for one `claude -p` spawn. Kept pure and separate from the
 * driver so the permission translation and the effort flag are testable without
 * spawning a process.
 *
 * The focused-environment mapping, verified against claude CLI 2.1.270.
 * `noMcpServers` is `--strict-mcp-config` (no `--mcp-config` is passed
 * anywhere here, which is what makes it load zero servers rather than some
 * named file's), `noSkillCatalog` is `--disable-slash-commands`, `toolAllowlist`
 * is `--tools` with the names comma-joined into one argument, and
 * `settingsPreserved` needs no flag at all — it is satisfied by those three
 * being per-property flags, none of which touches auth, the model, the effort
 * level or the permission mode.
 *
 * `--setting-sources ""` is the obvious companion to the skill flag and is
 * deliberately NOT emitted: measured here, it takes the repository's own
 * CLAUDE.md out of the spawn. With the three flags the spawn quotes this
 * repository's CLAUDE.md verbatim; with the fourth added it answers that it has
 * no such instructions. It was not earning its place either — the current draft
 * environment boots at 20,943 tokens, the three flags bring it to 9,613, and
 * the fourth reaches 8,494, about 1,100 tokens for the repository instructions
 * a plan writer is ordered to follow.
 *
 * The wholesale modes in `claude --help` are all refused for the same reason.
 * `--bare` restricts auth to an API key and never reads OAuth or the keychain,
 * moving the user off the subscription this engine bills against — and drivers
 * never handle credentials. `--restricted` refuses `bypassPermissions`, which
 * is what `full-access` maps to here, so it would silently downgrade a
 * configured permission level. `--safe-mode` disables CLAUDE.md along with the
 * skills, plugins and MCP servers. Each is also a bundle whose contents the
 * harness may change between versions, whereas four named per-property flags
 * are what let a capability record say exactly what is expressed.
