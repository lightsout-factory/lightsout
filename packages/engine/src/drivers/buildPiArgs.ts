/**
 * Assemble the argv for one `pi -p` / `omp -p` spawn. Kept pure and separate
 * from the driver so the permission translation and the thinking flag are
 * testable without spawning a process. Flag surface verified against
 * @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent 0.84.4 and omp 18.1.6.
 *
 * There is no granted-commands mapping here, on either variant. Bare pi has no
 * permission system to grant through at all. omp could carry per-prefix grants
 * in a `--config` overlay's `bash.patterns` allow rules, but an overlay
 * replaces that key wholesale — a user's own deny rules would silently vanish
 * for the spawned process, and a grant that can close what the user's settings
 * allow is not a grant this engine may make. The binding grant is the
 * prompt-level list the engine injects into the invocation, exactly as it
 * already is on codex.
 *
 * There is no focused-environment mapping here either, so a focused request
 * runs as an ordinary session. Both variants publish flags that could express
 * part of it — omp 18.1.6 has `--no-skills` and `--tools`, pi 0.84.4 has
 * `--tools` — but neither is wired yet, and neither publishes an MCP flag.
 * Neither variant reaches for a wholesale minimal mode to fake a control
 * its published flags cannot express, for the same reason the `--config`
 * overlay is refused above: a blunt instrument that can quietly close what a
 * user's own settings allow is not one this engine may use.
