 * after it with the same name, which is what makes the `willShip` stamp on the
 * manifest and the chain that eventually happens agree by construction.
 *
 * A `shipRequest` in the answer means the ticket's own record decides this run's
 * shipping; its absence means `--ship` and `ship.after-implement` decide it, as
 * they always have. Only the LOCAL record is read — no tracker call — because
 * the authoritative check is the ship guard's, which pulls first.
