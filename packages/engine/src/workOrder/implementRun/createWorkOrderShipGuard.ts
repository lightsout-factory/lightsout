 * `authorize` pulls before it answers, so a machine never authorizes a merge
 * against a record it already knows is behind — and a pull failure, a divergence
 * above all, is a refusal rather than a pass, because a record that cannot be
 * established cannot authorize anything. The one exception is a branch this
 * machine holds no record for: nothing about it is a ticket's business, so an
 * unreachable tracker cannot make it unshippable.
