 * Whether a run covers the whole of a plan rather than one phase file of it.
 *
 * Only a whole-plan run may claim a plan implemented, and only a whole-plan run
 * may satisfy a ship request — so the rule is asked both before a run, to decide
 * what its pass would mean, and after it, to decide what to record. Asking it in
 * one place is what keeps those two answers the same.
 *
 * A build from the ticket body counts: it is the whole of single-plan plan 001's
 * implementation, and it has no plan file of its own to name. A `--start-phase`
 * run of a plan folder counts too, because it is still started from the folder's
 * own `overview.md`.
 *
 * The path answers the plan it belongs to rather than being joined onto one,
 * which is the same field every other reader of a run's plan asks — a path is
 * taken here only because one caller asks before the run exists and so has no
 * manifest to read the name off.
 *
 * @returns true when the run covers the whole plan
