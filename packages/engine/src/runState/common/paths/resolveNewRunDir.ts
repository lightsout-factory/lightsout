 * Where a NEW run goes, from what the caller already knows.
 *
 * A `planName` answers that plan's ticket folder's runs folder — the folder
 * `workOrderNameOf` reads the address into. A `workOrderName` with no plan name answers that same folder reached from the
 * branch, which is how a direct run of a ticket is filed under the ticket it
 * builds. Neither answers the owning command's runs folder.
 *
 * A plan name wins if both arrive, because a plan's address names its ticket
 * too — the two inputs can never disagree.
 *
 * It shares `resolveRunDir`'s verb deliberately: both answer which directory,
 * and separating them by verb would suggest they differ in kind rather than in
 * whether the run exists yet. It creates nothing, for the same reason.
