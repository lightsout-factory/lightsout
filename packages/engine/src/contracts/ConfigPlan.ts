/**
 * The optional `plan` block of `lightsout.config.json` — whether this
 * repository's plans are written as contracts with an acceptance-test ledger,
 * the counts above which one plan file is heavy enough to earn the reader
 * fan-out, and whether a planning session works in its own worktree.
 *
 * Every switch but `worktree` is off by default, so an absent block writes and
 * grades plans exactly as every plan command did before those keys existed: the
 * same template, the same required sections, the reader fleet on every plan
 * file. `worktree` defaults on, as `implement.worktree` does, and
 * `default-work-order-mode` defaults to `single-plan`, which is how a work
 * order's folder behaved before it could hold several plans. Turning
 * `contract` on is a repository saying its plans carry the tests that state
 * their acceptance criteria, so grading may be mostly mechanical.
 *
 * `.strict()`, like every block of the config: a typo in an opt-in switch has to fail loudly rather
 * than silently leave the feature off.
