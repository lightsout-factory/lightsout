 * The optional `gate-overrides` block of `lightsout.config.json` — which gates
 * run at each of the four verification checkpoints.
 *
 * A listed checkpoint runs exactly the gates its entry names, in that order,
 * with no tiering; `"off"` runs none at all. An unlisted checkpoint keeps the
 * engine's default: the cheap gates first, and the expensive ones only once
 * every package group's cheap gates are green.
 *
 * `.strict()`, like every block of the config: a misspelled checkpoint has to fail loudly
 * rather than silently disable a schedule the author believes is set.
