/**
 * The optional `ticket-tracker` block of `lightsout.config.json` — who the

 * authenticates.
 *
 * Tracker identity is one fact, spelled once. It sits above `queue` rather than
 * inside it because the queue is no longer its only reader: publishing a plan to
 * its ticket needs a provider connection without needing a queue at all, and
 * two spellings of one fact would let those callers disagree about which team
 * or project a ticket lives in.
 *
 * `.strict()`, like every block of the config: a typo here would silently disable a setting the user
 * believes is active.
