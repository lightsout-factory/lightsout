 * Top-level rather than nested under `queue` or `implement` because both run the
 * same command: the queue prepares a tree per ticket, and an isolated
 * implementation run prepares one per run. A key living inside either block
 * would read as belonging to that one alone.
 *
 * `.strict()`, like every block of the config: a typo in an opt-in setting has to fail loudly rather
 * than silently leave the default in force.
