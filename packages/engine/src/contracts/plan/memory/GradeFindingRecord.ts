 * carried across passes. What it adds is provenance a single pass cannot hold —
 * when the question was first raised, the judge outcome that created it, the
 * citations that closed it, and every time a later pass reopened it.
 *
 * The top-level `phase`, `lens`, `area`, `gap`, `decision` and `options` are the
 * record's representative; `observations` holds every reader's own report of the
 * defect once a judge confirms several described one.
