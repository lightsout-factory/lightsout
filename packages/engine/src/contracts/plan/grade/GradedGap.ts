 * A gap as it is persisted in `grade.json`: what the reader reported, plus the
 * plan file it was found in, the lens that found it, and the judge's ruling on
 * who has to settle it. The engine stamps the phase and the lens after the
 * reader returns — the gap-check contract stays the bare `gaps` array, so an
 * agent can neither mislabel a gap's phase nor claim a lens it was not given —
 * and it stamps the outcome too whenever no judge settled the finding.
 *
 * The judge's half is spread in from `GapVerdict` rather than retyped, so the
 * shape the agent answers in and the shape written to disk stay related by
 * construction.
