/**
 * The persisted `grade.json`: a plan's grade plus the evidence behind it — the
 * deterministic structural findings and the agent-found decision gaps. `passed`
 * is the typed verdict the skill reads; it never re-implements a check.
 *
 * The coverage fields are what keep a partial pass honest. A checker that fails
 * or hits the rate-limit wall no longer discards everything its siblings found;
 * the report is written with `complete: false` and a `phasesChecked` naming only
 * the files every lens returned for, so a pass that did not finish can never be
 * skimmed as a clean bill. A `complete: false` report is never an A, whatever it
 * found.
 *
 * `complete` speaks for the whole plan rather than for this one pass: every plan
 * file is covered at its current text — by this pass or by a recorded earlier
 * one — the whole-plan documentation record stands, and nothing failed or was
 * withheld. A reader that failed or hit the wall leaves a plan file uncovered,
 * so the pass is incomplete; a judge that failed leaves one finding unweighed,
 * which is recorded as `unjudged` on that gap and blocks the grade on its own —
 * the pass still finished.
 *
 * `scopeComplete` answers a narrower question than `complete`: whether every
 * check THIS pass's own scope called for finished. A focused repair pass that
 * read every phase it owed is scope-complete whether or not the plan beside it
 * is covered. `complete` decides approval; `scopeComplete` decides only whether
 * the pass may become the baseline the next repair narrows against.
 *
 * `gradedAt` alone cannot tell a stale verdict from a current one: a grade taken
 * against code that has since moved on reads exactly like a fresh one. The
 * commit stamp beside it says WHAT was measured, not merely when.
