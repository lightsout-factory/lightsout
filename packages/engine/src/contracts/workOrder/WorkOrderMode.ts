/**
 * How one ticket's plans are organised, saved on the ticket's own record.
 *
 * `SinglePlan` means plan 001 alone supplies the ticket's implementation — that
 * one plan may still have phases — and the repository's automatic shipping
 * applies. `MultiplePlan` means
 * the ticket's plans implement in numeric order on one branch and the ticket
 * ships only when an explicit ship request naming the included plans is
 * satisfied.
 *
 * A ticket's mode is seeded from `plan.default-work-order-mode` when its record is
 * created — except that the queue creates the record of a ticket it builds from
 * the ticket body in single-plan mode — and is that ticket's own saved choice
 * from then on.
