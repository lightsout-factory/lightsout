/**
 * The optional `auto-plan` block of `lightsout.config.json` — which of
 * `/auto-plan`'s checkpoints a repo keeps and which it removes.
 *
 * Every key is off by default, so an absent block is the most supervised
 * behaviour there is: the skill plans the whole ticket, shows one proposal of
 * the finished plan, and stops. Turning a key on is a repo saying the factory
 * may carry on that far without asking.
 *
 * No engine code reads this block — the skill does, straight off the file. It
 * is declared here anyway because every key a config may write is validated,
 * described and shown by the config view; a key only a skill knew about would
 * be invisible to `doctor` and to the config page, and a typo in it would
 * silently disable a setting the user believes is on.
 *
 * `.strict()`, like every block of the config: the typo above has to fail loudly.
