/**
 * One mark per process rather than per logical request: a request re-run after
 * a malformed answer really did cost money twice, and summing the spawns would
 * report an expensive agent where the truth is a repeatedly rejected answer.
 * `spawn` and `reemit` are what make those rows tell each other apart, and
 * `effort` is carried because two spawns of one step can differ in nothing
 * else.
 *
 * It carries no id of its own: nothing references a process, and an id nobody
 * reads is a field that goes stale. It carries no exit code and no failure text
 * either — `endReason` already answers how the process ended.
