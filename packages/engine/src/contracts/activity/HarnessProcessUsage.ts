 * process never reaches — so per field is the only granularity that can hold
 * that truth. An absent field means not reported and is rendered as such; a
 * present `0` is a real zero.
 *
 * It deliberately does not reuse `AgentUsage`, whose five fields are all
 * required and which drivers omit whole.
