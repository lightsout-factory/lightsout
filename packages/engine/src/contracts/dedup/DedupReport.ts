/**
 * The persisted `dedup.json`: every confirmed prior-art duplication the Dedup
 * Review pass surfaced for a plan. An empty `findings` array is the clean
 * result — no name-collides remained or the judge ruled every candidate
 * distinct. The skill reads this to conduct the interactive resolution.
 *
 * The coverage pair is what keeps a partial scan honest: one judge per plan file
 * runs concurrently, and a failed or rate-limited judge no longer discards what
 * its siblings found. It ends the pass `complete: false` instead, so an
 * unfinished scan can never be read as "no duplication found".
 *
 * `findings` and `reviewed` answer different questions. The first is the work
 * left to do; the second is what this pass looked at. Only the second can say
 * that a collision still detectable on disk has already been weighed, which is
 * what stops `plan grade` nudging about it for the rest of the plan's life.
