/**
 * Run one plan subcommand's work with an open command-run level in hand, and
 * record it in the plan folder's activity record: the plan level, and this
 * command's own level beneath it, both closed on the way out whatever happened.
 *
 * It sits beside `recordPlanningStep` rather than extending it — that one keys
 * five named planning steps into `planning-progress.json`, which
 * `lightsout status --planning` reads live, while this one opens two levels of
 * a general append-only record under a free-text label. Three things are
 * borrowed from it deliberately, because the two wrappers nest and a reader has
 * to recognise the shape: the work is wrapped rather than instrumented from
 * outside, the end is written in a `finally` so a throw still closes the level
 * and rethrows, and a failed write is one stderr line rather than a failed plan
 * command.
 *
 * The plan level is closed on every command run rather than only on the last
 * one, because no process knows it is the last; the fold's earliest-start and
 * latest-end rules are what turn that into one correct plan span. And the
 * folder is resolved from `planWorkspaceDir` rather than from a path a caller
 * passes, so the record can only ever land in the main checkout.
 *
 * A caller with no plan name — an implement run pointed at a plan file outside
 * the plans directory — has no folder the record belongs in, so nothing is
 * resolved, nothing is written, and the work runs holding no level.
