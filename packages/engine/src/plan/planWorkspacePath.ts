 * This is the spelling a run manifest's `plan` field carries and the one
 * `getPlanDocument` takes, so the code that matches runs to a plan and the code
 * that builds a file's path both ask here instead of writing the prefix twice.
 * It is `planWorkspaceDir`'s relative twin and names exactly the folder that
 * helper resolves, which is why the two spell the layout's segments together
 * rather than through a constant neither of them would be the only reader of.
