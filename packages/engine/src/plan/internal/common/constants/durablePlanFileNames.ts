/**
 * The one answer to which files in a plan folder travel. Everything else the
 * folder holds — agent transcripts, manifests, progress logs — is run state,
 * and run state never leaves the machine that made it.
 *
 * One object rather than two exports: publish writes an attachment per name
 * here, and the fetch matches an attachment's title against exactly the same
 * names. Two lists could be updated apart, which would leave a file publish
 * uploads and the fetch never looks for.
 *
 * `deliverable` is the naming rule, copied from `resolvePlanDeliverable`, and
 * it is NOT a safety guard: it admits a path separator exactly as the resolver's
 * own pattern does, which is harmless against a directory listing and is not
 * harmless against an attachment title a stranger can set. A caller reading
 * titles off a ticket rejects a non-bare file name before consulting this
 * field, and must not narrow the field to do it — a narrower pattern here would
 * stop mirroring the resolver, and a phase file publish uploads would be one the
 * fetch silently refuses to restore.
 *
 * The annotation is written out rather than left to `as const` so `records` is a
 * `string[]` a caller can `includes` a plain string against without a cast.
 *
 * `grade-memory.json` travels and `grade-history.jsonl` does not, because they
 * are different kinds of thing: the memory holds the plan's settled decisions —
 * which questions a human answered, and where the plan states each answer — so
 * planning resumed on another machine has to keep it. The history and the agent
 * transcripts beside it are local debugging state about how a grade was reached.
 *
 * `brainstorm-notes.md` sits in the plan folder but belongs to the brainstorm
 * generation, which is why it is spelled here as `brainstormNotesFileName`
 * rather than as a literal, and why `isPlanOnlyAttachmentName` leaves it out of
 * every plan generation.
