 * Re-run the deterministic citation check on every `resolved` record, against

 *
 * A resolution is a claim about the plan's text at one location. Once the text
 * no longer says it — an edit deleted the Decision Log row, a repair moved the
 * file the citation named — the question is unanswered again and must stop
 * reading as settled. A record resolved at several locations reopens when any
 * one of them is lost, and every stored resolution goes with it: a group whose
 * repair came undone in one place is unresolved as a whole. It costs no agent,
 * so it runs on every semantic pass and runs before the re-verification judges
 * are chosen, which is what lets the same pass re-ask a record it just reopened.
 *
 * A `noted` record carries no verified citation, so a citation the plan no
 * longer holds says nothing about it; its own reopen path is a judge matching a
 * fresh finding to it.
