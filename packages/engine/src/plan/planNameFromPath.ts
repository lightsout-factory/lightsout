/**
 * The plan a `--plan` value names, or undefined when the value does not live in
 * a ticket's plans folder.
 *
 * `planWorkspaceDir` and `planWorkspacePath` build a path from a name; this
 * reads a name back out of one, so the rules that are about a plan's name — the
 * ticket it carries above all — can be asked of a command that takes a path
 * instead. It asks `workOrdersDir` rather than writing the prefix again, and
 * resolves the given value through `resolveRecordedPlanPath` so that a
 * tickets-directory path handed from a linked worktree is rooted where
 * `workOrdersDir` answers: rooting the two differently would relativise every such
 * path to a walk-up and read as no plan at all.
 *
 * A path inside a plan subfolder of a ticket's plans folder answers that plan's
 * address, spelled with `/` whatever the platform's path separator is, because
 * the address is the `--name` value every plan subcommand takes. Every other
 * path inside that plans folder answers undefined: no plan lives loose there.
 *
 * Only `plans/` is a plan's home, so a path under a ticket's `runs/` folder —
 * and the ticket folder itself — answers undefined rather than claiming the
 * ticket's name: a run inside a ticket folder that belongs to no plan must say
 * so, since this answer is what a run manifest records.
 *
 * A path anywhere else answers undefined too: a `--plan` pointing at an
 * arbitrary markdown file is not a plan workspace, and its parent folder's name
 * is nobody's convention to keep.
