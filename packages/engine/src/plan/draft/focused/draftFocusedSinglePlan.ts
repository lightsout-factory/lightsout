/**
 * Draft a single plan with the focused implementation, with one escape.
 *
 * It mirrors `draftSinglePlan` step for step and differs in four places: the
 * writer is handed the evidence the engine collected once instead of re-reading
 * source itself, `## Global Constraints` is composed from the decisions record
 * beside the Decision Log, the convergence runs the deterministic mechanical
 * repair before each round's lint, and the escalation goes to the focused phased
 * flow.
 *
 * Both engine section syncs run after the writer returns and before the
 * convergence, so the closing lint reads the sections the engine owns rather than
 * whatever the writer left. No `overviewPath` is passed to the convergence: a
 * standalone plan has no overview to render a phase table into.
 *
 * A single plan cannot be split by the structural repairer — the engine hands it
 * exactly one output path — so a busted created-file or touched-file ceiling is
 * the blocking finding that loop can never resolve. Rather than dead-ending on
 * a defect the engine can work out itself, the draft re-runs once as phased from
 * the same facts and decisions. The phased flow never escalates back, so the retry is
 * taken at most once, and only for these two checks.
