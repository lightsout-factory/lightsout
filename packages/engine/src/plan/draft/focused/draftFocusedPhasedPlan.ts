/**
 * Draft a phased plan with the focused implementation: an overview spawn, a
 * deterministic door check on the breakdown it declares, then one concurrent
 * spawn per declared phase, and the usual structural repair over the finished
 * set.
 *
 * It mirrors `draftPhasedPlan` step for step and differs in five places: the
 * overview spawn carries the draft's evidence brief, `## Global Constraints` is
 * composed beside every Decision Log sync, the paired `## Phases` row and
 * `### Phase <N> — ` declaration heading are rendered from one record straight
 * after the counts are stamped, the fan-out is the focused one, and the
 * convergence runs the deterministic mechanical repair before each round's lint.
 *
 * Three orderings are load-bearing. The door check runs before any phase spawn is
 * paid for, because that is the cheapest moment to refuse an unbuildable phase.
 * The overview is re-synced after it, because a reshape round rewrites
 * `overview.md` while a phase writer authors against the text in its prompt. And
 * `syncPhaseSections` runs after the counts are stamped rather than before,
 * because the stamp is what turns the overview's estimate into the fact that
 * section renders.
 *
 * The overview spawn gets no self-lint, because at the end of it no phase file
 * exists and `resolvePlanDeliverable` would answer `no plan found` — handing an
 * agent a command that always errors teaches it to ignore the section.
 *
 * A phase that busts the created-file ceiling here — legitimate, since the
 * declared counts were an estimate and the declaration a floor — surfaces as a
 * blocking finding from the closing lint and, unresolved, hands back. It is
 * deliberately NOT escalated to another breakdown reshape: re-splitting would
 * invalidate every phase file already authored, paying for the whole fan-out
 * twice to fix one phase.
