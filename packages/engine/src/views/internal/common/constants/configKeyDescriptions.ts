/**
 * What each `lightsout.config.json` key is for, in the schema's own words.
 *
 * Transcribed from `LightsoutConfig`'s doc comments rather than read from them:
 * TypeScript doc comments are erased before anything runs, so a transcription is
 * the only honest route to the sentence a reader of the file would see.
 *
 * The `timeouts.` entries are the block's leaves rather than shape keys: the
 * block's defaults are per leaf, so the page gives each its own row and each row
 * needs its own sentence.
 *
 * This is also what `docs/configuration.md`'s key reference is rendered from, so
 * a sentence edited here changes that document and `pnpm check` fails until
 * `pnpm build:config-reference` has been run.

	effort: "Reasoning effort passed through to the harness — one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` or `max`. Omit to take each harness's own default.",
	permissions:
		"Harness-neutral capability level for agent invocations: `write` lets agents edit files and run commands inside the workspace, `full-access` bypasses the harness's sandbox entirely. Defaults to 'write'. `read-only` is engine-selected for the supervisor and is deliberately not settable — it would make a writing role write nothing.",
	commands:
		'Per-command harness selection for `plan`, `implement`, `refactor`, `test-coverage-to-threshold` and `improve` (`plan` covers draft, dedup and grade; `resume` always keeps the run manifest’s recorded harness). Each entry overrides the global harness, model and effort for that command; unlisted commands use the globals. A global model is not inherited by a command that selects a different harness; a global effort is, because the five levels mean the same thing everywhere. An unknown command key is rejected rather than silently ignored.',

	timeouts: 'Agent invocation ceilings, in minutes. A hit ceiling is a recorded step failure the run can resume from — never a crash.',
	'timeouts.agent-minutes':
		'Ceiling for the working roles — executor, test writers, refactorer, fixes. Defaults to 60. Reaching it stops the harness together with every process it started — a terminate signal first, then a kill if that is ignored.',
	'timeouts.supervisor-minutes': 'Ceiling for the read-only supervisor, which reads and rules rather than editing. Defaults to 15.',
	'timeouts.gate-minutes':
		"Ceiling for one gate command — the repo's own check, test, coverage, build or end-to-end run. A gate that runs past it is stopped and re-run once; a gate that runs past it again stops the run as a timeout, which names the gate and the ceiling and is reported apart from a gate that failed. Such a gate is never handed to a fix agent and spends no fix attempt. Defaults to 15.",
	'agent-commands':
		'Command prefixes working agents are granted (prefix match, arguments allowed) — for plan deliverables only a command can produce, such as a migration generator. Verification commands never belong here: the engine runs all gates itself. The one verification command an agent is handed is the engine’s own self-check, granted per spawn to the roles that write code rather than configured here.',
	generated:
		'Path prefixes of generated or derived files. Real files in the diff, but excluded from changed-file attribution — the source that generates them is the change. Also where a repo says its build output lands when the walk cannot guess it. A worker’s commit never carries them — the pre-ship step at merge time is the one place they are committed.',
	vendored:
		'Path prefixes of third-party code the repo vendors in rather than writes, such as a shadcn/ui component folder. Excluded from the source walk exactly as `generated` is, so the standards never judge it, no test is written for it and no refactor pass touches it — with one difference: a vendored file IS attributed when it changes, because no source in the repo produced it. Excluding it from a coverage threshold is your test runner’s job, not the engine’s.',
	'coverage-summary-path':
		'Path to the JSON coverage summary the coverage tooling writes — the `json-summary` reporter’s `coverage-summary.json`, which `lightsout test-coverage-to-threshold` reads for per-file percentages. Defaults to `coverage/coverage-summary.json`, repo-relative in single-package repos and package-relative in monorepo mode. The file is the tool-agnostic contract, so a printed coverage table changing format never breaks a run.',
	'executor-file-limit': `How many source files one plan or phase may create or modify before the feature executor refuses it as out of scope. Defaults to 50. One key rather than a number per reader, so the plan lint, the scope estimate and the executor’s own stop rule agree by construction. A plan that is mostly mechanical edits raises its own allowance with a \`## File Budget\` section rather than moving this key, but a \`## File Budget\` cannot lift a plan or phase past the fixed touched-file ceiling of ${touchedFileCeiling} source files unless that plan or phase is rename-only; the separate ceiling on files a plan creates is fixed and cannot be raised either way.`,
	'packages-dir': 'Directory holding workspace packages, for monorepo scoped gates. Defaults to `packages`.',
	'package-gates':

	'gate-overrides':
		'Opt-in per-checkpoint gate schedules, keyed by the four verification checkpoints — `clean-slate`, `verify-implement`, `verify-tests` and `verify-refactor`. A checkpoint listed with an array runs exactly those gates, in that order, with no tiering, and a red one stops the rest of the list; `"off"` runs no gates at all there, `gates.generate` included. A checkpoint the block does not list keeps the engine’s default: the cheap gates first — check, then the unit suite — and the expensive ones, each custom `test-*` suite and the build, only once every package group’s cheap gates are green. A name must be a gate this repo configures under `gates` or `package-gates`; `generate` and `format` may not be named.',
	'standards-packs':
		'Standards packs a run works against. Unspecified = the pack the plugin ships; `false` = explicitly none; an array = exactly these pack roots, each the folder holding `lightsout-standards.json`, repo-relative or absolute. One pack carries both the code and the test documents, which is why there is a single key rather than two. A root that cannot be loaded is a hard error.',
	'standards-channels':
		"Framework channels of the loaded standards packs (e.g. 'react', 'tanstack'). Unspecified = detected per run from the scoped packages' package.json dependencies; an array REPLACES detection, and an empty one means base documents only.",
	'standards-checks':
		'Per-rule severity and settings overrides for `lightsout standards-check`, keyed by rule id. A rule not named here keeps its pack’s default — silence is never a change.',
	ship: 'Opt-in `lightsout ship` settings: the branch ticket pattern whose `ticket` capture group becomes the result’s ticket reference, the pull request body template, the merge method, whether a passed implement run chains into ship, an optional pre-ship command that prepares the release candidate before it is verified, and the explicit exception for a repository that intentionally has no CI.',
	'ticket-tracker':
		'Opt-in tracker identity: which provider the engine talks to and that provider’s address and credential environment variables — a Linear team and API key, or a Jira Cloud site, project, API token and account email. Every command that reads or writes a ticket resolves it from here, so tracker identity is spelled once rather than once per command.',
	worktree:
		'Opt-in shared workspace preparation. `worktree.setup` is the one command run inside a fresh worktree before any agent, such as `pnpm install` — the queue runs it in each ticket worktree it cuts, and an isolated implementation run runs it in the worktree it cuts for itself. An absent block means nothing runs. The block is strict, so a misspelled key fails parsing rather than silently leaving the command unset.',
	queue:
		'Opt-in queue settings: which ticket label names each planning status, what this tracker calls each status the engine writes, which statuses count as available work, how many tickets run at once, and the per-ticket worker and question timeouts. Tracker identity lives in `ticket-tracker`, so this block holds queue behaviour only.',
	'auto-plan':
		'Opt-in auto-plan settings: whether the proposal comes before drafting, whether an approved proposal starts the build, and whether the proposal is skipped when nothing clears the escalation bar. Every key is off by default, so an absent block is the most supervised behaviour.',
	plan: "Opt-in plan settings: whether plans are written as contracts with an acceptance-test ledger — a table naming the test that states each acceptance criterion — and graded by weight, spawning the reader fan-out only for the plan files that earn it, plus the counts above which a plan file is heavy. Those are off by default, so an absent block writes and grades plans exactly as before: the same template, the same required sections, every plan file read by every lens. `plan.worktree` is whether a planning session works in its own isolated git worktree rather than the checkout it was launched from — it defaults to true, `--worktree` and `--no-worktree` override it for one command, and the implementation run continues in the tree planning established. `plan.default-work-order-mode` is the mode a work order's own record is created with — `single-plan`, where plan 001 alone supplies the work order's implementation, or `multiple-plan`, where the work order's plans implement in numeric order on one branch and it ships only on an explicit ship request. It defaults to `single-plan` and is read only when a record is created, so it never changes a work order that already has one. The queue creates the record of a ticket it builds from the ticket body — a `planning-not-needed` ticket, or a `planning-complete` ticket with no record yet — in `single-plan` mode whatever the key says.",
	implement:
		'Opt-in implementation settings. `implement.worktree` is whether an implementation run builds in its own isolated git worktree rather than the checkout it was launched from — it defaults to true, and `--worktree` and `--no-worktree` override it for one run. `implement.refactor.max-rounds` is how many cleanup executor rounds one run may spend at most — a whole number above zero, defaulting to 2, which is also what an absent block spends. The budget is a ceiling rather than a target: cleanup stops early when nothing qualifying is left, and only a deterministic blocking finding the run’s own edits introduced or measurably worsened can spend a round. Whatever cleanup leaves behind is recorded and never stops the run.',
	pricing:
		'Optional published rates, keyed by the model identifier a harness was invoked with, each entry giving `input`, `output`, `cache-read` and `cache-write` as US dollars per million tokens — the unit vendors publish, so a rate is copied rather than converted. It is optional and has no default. It is read only by `lightsout report`, where it buys one separate, clearly labelled estimated-cost column; nothing computed from it is ever stored, so the activity record stays a statement of what a harness itself reported. Each entry is strict, so a misspelled rate name fails parsing rather than silently leaving that token count unpriced while the column still prints a total.',
	docs: 'Opt-in documentation surfaces: each entry a repo-relative path and a one-line `covers` saying what that document is responsible for. Declaring the block turns on the plan-time documentation check — the plan writer is briefed on the surfaces, every implementable plan file must carry a `## Documentation` statement, and `plan grade` runs one whole-plan checker that verifies it. A repository that declares no block sees none of it: no section, no prompt text, no checker spawn.',
