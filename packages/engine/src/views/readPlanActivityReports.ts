/**
 * The data half of a plan report: plan names in, totalled trees out, nothing
 * printed.
 *
 * A plan folder holding no activity record answers an entry whose `report` is
 * absent rather than failing the read for the plan beside it — a list is an
 * account of what is there, the bargain `listPlanWorkspaces` strikes for a
 * workspace whose grade file will not parse. A folder whose record is partly
 * written answers a tree built from the marks that parsed, because a record cut
 * off when its process was killed still proves everything above the cut.
 *
 * Order follows the given names.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the CLI for the reason every other reader in
 * this folder does: the web app reads this module, and a calculation the
 * terminal owns is one a second surface has to repeat. It takes resolved names
 * rather than a raw `--plan` value, so the CLI's name-resolution rules stay in
 * the CLI.
