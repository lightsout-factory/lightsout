// step failure: it parks the run so a human can resume it, which means every
// group still waiting for a slot must never spawn — and every writer already in
// flight must still be accounted for. An ordinary failure is the contrast case:
// it takes down nothing but its own writer.

// The fan-out's scenarios are split by concern, and each suite arranges its own
// writers. The stub below is restated per suite deliberately: a fixture reached
// across module lines would have to import this module's internals from outside
// it, and the barrel is not the place to publish a type only a test names.
