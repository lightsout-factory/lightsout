// and the config route reaches the engine's filesystem reader at the far end of
// that chain. Stubbing the reader keeps the whole graph off disk, and lets this
// file state the config it is rendering rather than asserting against whatever
// this repo's own lightsout.config.json happens to say today.

// `createRouter`, the `createFileRoute` calls the tree is assembled from, and
// the `notFound` the server function throws — stays real, since the tree is what
