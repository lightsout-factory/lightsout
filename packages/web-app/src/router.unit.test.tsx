// Building a router loads the generated route tree, which loads every route
// module and everything those render — and the runs route reaches the engine's
// filesystem reader at the far end of that chain. Stubbing the reader keeps the
// graph off disk, leaving this file asserting on what `getRouter` itself
// decides: where the app can navigate, and what it renders when a route throws
// or matches nothing. Nothing here is called while a router is built.

// require an ESM-only cookie package that Jest's CommonJS loader cannot parse.
// All it does is subscribe the query client to the router it is handed and
// return that same router, so a pass-through stands in for it — and the spy is
// what lets a test prove the two halves were given the *same* client.
