/**
 * The Standards Pack lightsout ships, as cards: one per set of rules it holds —
 * TypeScript, React, TanStack — each opening its rules, then a card for a
 * team's own.
 *
 * Static by design: this is what every repo gets out of the box, read from the
 * copy bundled into the app, so it reads the same on the web as on a machine
 * with a repo open. A set with no rules in it is never a card: the listing
 * counts rules per channel and leaves out a channel of prose alone.
